AB  - Purpose – Teachers constitute one of the largest groups of knowledge workers. The purpose of this paper is to examine the antecedents and outcomes of teachers’ task and extra-role performance (ERP) under two different autonomy regimes in charter and regular public schools. A special emphasis was given to the ERP of teachers. Both the predictors and outcomes of teacher work performance were comparatively investigated in these two different school environments. Design/methodology/approach – By applying a social-cognitive perspective and a causal comparative design, the study comparatively tested the reciprocal relationships among the study variables in public and charter schools. The clustered sample included 812 public school teachers and 112 charter school teachers. Findings – The findings revealed that the predictors and outcomes of teachers’ task and ERP have differing dynamics in these two distinct types of public schools. The School Type, which represented the differences in school autonomy between public and charter schools, appeared to be the strongest differentiating factor across two groups of schooling. Both types of teacher performance (task and extra role) in charter schools outweighed their counterparts in public schools. Similarities and differences were observed on the predictors and outcomes of teacher work performance. Originality/value – The current study contributed to the scant literature on the effects of school autonomy on teacher task and ERP. A clear understanding on the predictors and outcomes of teacher work performance under two different school autonomy regimes may guide practitioners and policymakers in their efforts to bring public schools to a more competitive edge. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - This research aims to identify the institutional strategies of incumbent firms with regard to sustainable energy innovations that threaten their interests. This exploratory study contributes to the multi-level perspective by providing new insights into niche-regime interaction. The focus on actor behavior in transitions is informed by literature from institutional theory and strategic management. Based on semi-structured interviews with actors and on documents related to LED lighting and biofuels in the Netherlands, this study identified a preliminary set of empirical strategies: providing information and arguments to policy makers and the general public, as well as strategically setting technical standards. Incumbents are in a position to significantly influence the innovation's development by employing these strategies; thus temporarily keeping sustainable innovation on a leash. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB  - Equity is frequently cited as one of the key design aspects of environmental governance regimes. In the context of Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+), a forest-based climate change mitigation instrument, the manner in which 'equity' is understood will be of critical importance for the impacts and acceptance of REDD+policies and initiatives. Whereas the concept has been extensively studied in the academic literature, references to equity in REDD+policy debates and documents are often vague, leaving room for various interpretations and modes of implementation. In our case study of the Tanzanian national REDD+policy domain, we provide a conceptual framework based on an institutional logics approach for analysing the various underlying rationalities in the 'equity in REDD+' debate. We apply it to demonstrate how the involved policy actors draw from heterogeneous equity logics in their support for and opposition to different governance models, highlighting the importance of precise contextualization and operationalization of broad international principles in national REDD+initiatives. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB  - Relationships for speed–flow, speed–fuel consumption (speed–carbon emission rates) and speed–accident occurrences for highway (expressway) driving conditions are reviewed. The optimal speeds for maximising traffic flow capacity on highly utilised expressways in Singapore lies in the range of 45–65 km/h, a speed band that the Land Transport Authority (Singapore) uses in its Electronic Road Pricing (ERP). On the other hand, the optimal speed range lies between 50 and 75 km/h based on efficient fuel consumption. As for carbon emission rates of the vehicular flow, the optimal speed range is 50–60 km/h. In terms of accident occurrences, the general norm is that low travel speeds as well as low speed variability are desirable. Experimental runs have shown that a relatively low speed band is preferred for greater fuel efficiency. Setting operating speeds that straddle the optimum regimes of capacity, safety and environmental sustainability suggests a range of 50–60 km/h. © 2014, © 2014 The Institution of Engineers, Singapore.

AB  - This paper studies the experience of foreign-funded programmes aimed at establishing participatory forest management (PFM), primarily in the walnut-fruit forests of Kyrgyzstan. Having reviewed programme reports, non-governmental organization evidence and legislation, we argue that the poor performance of these programmes is due largely to incorrect starting assumptions about the feasibility of PFM in the Kyrgyz context and a lack of analysis about locally appropriate forestry regimes. We show that there have been no significant preconditions for realization of PFM mechanisms in the history of Kyrgyz forestry, and their realization has been hampered by the Soviet legacy, strong informal institutions and poverty. We argue that PFM has been introduced without a clear understanding of how it fits in the overall vision of the country's development. Moreover, PFM is not fit for purpose in Kyrgyzstan, as it does not address the root macro-economic and environmental causes of existing forestry problems. The capacity of local communities should not be over-emphasized where cross-sectoral national or even cross-border efforts are required. Mutual, joint learning of Western donors with local experts is key, and should not be replaced by automatic adoption of imported concepts. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB  - The paper analyses the political challenges and opportunities of advancing the climate change agenda in a developing country under constraints and channels imposed by divided authority at the vertical level and political fragmentation within the state. The articles focuses on historical and political institutional arrangements to approach the current framework of climate change agenda-setting in Mexico, later analysing the potential changes to the outcomes due to the influence of an international climate change regime. On the one hand, the literature suggests that federalism poses serious limitations to government efficacy due to division of competences, and a similar argument is posed about presidentialism under a politically fragmented regime; on the second hand, transnationalism is depicted to enhance subnational state and non-state actor leadership roles in many areas, including economic and environmental policy setting. Evidence shows that federalism and the political fragmentation of the presidential regime in Mexico has prevented the federal government from taking assertive steps to influence subnational governments, while some of the heads of politically relevant subnational governments have assumed policy leadership roles, enabled by transnational networks and the Kyoto climate change regime. This balance may change according to the nature of the post-Kyoto regime, either strengthening the federal government if more responsibility on actions and disbursement is placed on national governments; or enabling subnational government to foster their position, if decentralized and transnational networks are strengthened. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB  - Extreme events such as floods present major challenges for water governance in many parts of the world. Following two rounds of disastrous floods in 2010 and 2011, the need for a change in Pakistan's approach to dealing with floods has been highlighted in the literature. However, scant attention has been given to the nature of an alternative framework and the mechanism for driving a change towards it. This research aims to provide a better understanding of how Pakistan can cope with future flood challenges by examining the role of learning processes in facilitating a change towards an adaptive governance framework that is considered useful for dealing with complex issues in an uncertain environment. Key informant interviews and document analysis are used to examine characteristics of the current regime, analyse the influence of learning processes on flood governance dynamics, and identify barriers and bridges to change. Study findings show that state actors continue to dominate flood governance. However, the actor network in emergency flood management has broadened, with increasing participation by non-state actors. Single-loop learning, limited to routine improvements, is predominant among state actors in preventive management. A few state and non-state actors in emergency management exhibit double-loop learning reflected by their reframing of problems and incorporation of new information. However, in the absence of any triple-loop learning associated with a paradigm change, the overall impact of learning processes in facilitating a transition towards more adaptive approaches to flood governance has been limited. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB  - Resource extraction often precludes sustainable forms of land use and poses long-term threats, and yet it is promoted as a development opportunity for poor countries. This is illustrated by a case study of the Kumtor gold mine in Kyrgyzstan. Compared with a large gold mine, most alternative activities, such as tourism, trophy hunting, cottage industry and pastoralism, can only generate negligible benefits. Other, potentially much more important, sources of income for poor countries are payments for ecosystem services taking the form of compensation preventing unsustainable forms of land use. The discussion focuses on how these could be organized to provide viable alternatives to mining. It is concluded that such systems need to be arranged at the international level and to complement the current international cooperation (aid) regime. In Central Asia, reviving the regional water management system would be an important first step in this direction. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB  - The Baltic Sea region has in recent years become known as a pioneer of new modes of governance, reflecting the dynamic development of the network society. At the same time, the Baltic Sea is considered one of the world's most polluted seas, especially in terms of eutrophication, the accelerated enrichment of nutrients in the water. Overall, there is a contrast between the formally successful governance system and the actual state of the Baltic Sea. This paper describes the existing Baltic Sea environmental governance system, from the regional regime to non-governmental actors, noting that highly institutionalized inter-state and transnational environmental cooperation adds a greater element of hierarchy for environmental governance in the region. Supporting democratic development is a special requirement for governance in the post-Cold War context. The paper explicates governance challenges posed by the emerging network society, on the one hand, and the problem of eutrophication, on the other, and makes suggestions on how to develop the governance system in order to meet the challenges. As a conclusion, a general lesson for the management of international water bodies is given. Institutional diversity with many different scale preoccupations is key, but so is the need for leaders to overcome the challenges of polycentric governance: that is, to reduce opacity of governing and to increase the power of stakeholders to define the problem and its solutions in the first place. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB  - The current study attempts to understand the relationships among Environmental Quality (EQ), Human Development (HD) and political and governance regimes in a cross-country framework through secondary data analysis. The underlying hypothesis is that in addition to income, as reflected from the literature on the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis, several other factors, including socioeconomic (e.g. human development and corruption) and sociopolitical (e.g. ability to exercise democratic rights) factors, may influence environmental policy-making, and thereby environmental sustainability, in a country. The EQ (i.e. environmental sustainability) of the countries in the current study is denoted by their Environmental Performance Index (2008). Human development is represented by Human Development Index (2007). Democracy Index (2008) and Corruption Perceptions Index (2008) are considered as proxies for political transparency in a country and its susceptibility to rent-seeking activities, respectively. The cross-country empirical findings confirm the closer association between the socioeconomic and sociopolitical factors and sustainable development. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. and ERP Environment.

AB  - Over the past decade, partnerships have increasingly become a popular governance instrument for sustainable development. This article aims to improve our understanding of this instrument, and its contributions to and consequences for international sustainable development politics, by providing the lessons learned from international biodiversity governance. The article analyses 24 international partnerships working on forests, fisheries, conservation and climate change, using perspectives based on regime, governance and partnership literature. It concludes that the contribution of the partnerships should be evaluated as varying: only seven 'gems' of partnerships fulfil important governance functions; the others play less paramount roles. Partnerships have, however, contributed to the ongoing change in the manner in which biodiversity is governed, namely the institutionalization of intersectoral governance. The article promotes a more strategic use of the partnership instrument, taking into account its opportunities and limitations, to strengthen its contributions to international sustainable development. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB  - Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic for the treatment of schizophrenia, in which memory impairment is a core deficit. The methods of positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS), Wechsler memory scale-4th edition (WMS-IV) and event-related potential (ERP) were used to study the effects of olanzapine on the cognitive function in the first-episode schizophrenic patients. We performed multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial to study the cognitive functioning in Han Chinese first-episode schizophrenic patients in a 12-week treatment regime with olanzapine (129 cases) or placebo (132 cases). The results showed that (1) the patients with first-episode schizophrenia showed significant deficits in the long-term memory, short-term memory, immediate memory and memory quotient by WMS-IV assessment, and decreases the total scores, positive symptoms, negative symptoms and general psychopathology by PANSS assessment; (2) olanzapine could significantly improve the PANSS scores including total scores, positive symptoms, negative symptoms and general psychopathology in the first-episode schizophrenic patients; (3) olanzapine could significantly improve the short-term memory, immediate memory and memory quotient in the first-episode schizophrenic patients; and (3) although the latencies of P2, N2 and P3 were significantly prolonged, P2 and P3 amplitudes were decreased and the latencies of N1 did not change, olanzapine did not influence any P300 items in the first-episode schizophrenic patients. The data suggested that that olanzapine could improve cognitive process, such as memorizing and extraction of the information although there were many changes of cognitive functions in Han Chinese first-episode schizophrenic patients. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This article examines the relationship between technology and policy change, focusing on shifts in Israel's water regime as a case example. Technologies, especially systems of large-scale infrastructures, have offered an explanation for the stability and stagnation of policy regimes in what has been termed "lock-in" and path dependency. Our paper focuses on the reverse phenomenon: on how technology or change in it can induce policy change. Israeli decision-makers have recently embraced desalination technology as a substitute for natural resources, because earlier policies, characterized by a strategy of environmental brinkmanship, have resulted in degradation of natural sources and risk future supply. This analysis is based on extensive document analysis and in-depth interviews. We suggest that technological breakthroughs that rendered desalination economically feasible also undermined long-lasting hydro-ideological support for agriculture, introduced new ideas about water abundance and engendered policy change. Desalination contributed to these shifts because it allowed the displacement of environmental externalities, economic costs and hard political choices to other policy sectors and levels of governance as well as reallocating them between political actors, bureaucrats and professionals. It is important to make displacements like these more visible in order to emphasize more comprehensive and longer-term problem solving rather than problem avoidance or postponement. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB  - Using a case study of accounting regime change in a Malaysian company, this paper analyses how an accounting regime was changed to overcome an instance of decoupling that management of the case company perceived to be problematic and, despite certain technological and managerial improvements, why the accounting regime yet remained decoupled from the control of core operations. Through an eclectic use of ANT, neo-institutionalism and political economy, it demonstrates that accounting remains decoupled from operational processes because of the particular manner in which accounting is constructed and enabled; the ostensive characteristics of accounting objects around which performativity of accounting is defined; and the organisational context, which involves certain 'political imperfections' that cannot be narrated within organisational apparatus of modernity. Accounting, being an apparatus of modernity, finds it difficult to codify such 'imperfections' and to offer an operational doctrine to govern the real business processes that are embedded within these 'imperfections'. Hence, it remains decoupled from core operational activities but performs an important role of insulating 'political imperfections' with which business operates. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Over the last decades, new governance mechanisms such as partnerships have been increasingly accepted as instruments for sustainable development. This article contributes to an improved understanding of the contributions of partnerships, and their interactions with and consequences for intergovernmental regimes. It answers the question to what extent the roles of international intersectoral partnerships in biodiversity governance can be assessed using a positive, negative, or utilitarian qualification. To answer this question, the article develops and applies a methodology to analyze the governance functions that partnerships fulfill, and the institutional interaction (in terms of content, discourses, and rules) between the partnerships and intergovernmental regimes. Two case studies are analyzed: the Great Apes Survival Project (GRASP), and the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund (CEPF), which works on biodiversity hotspots. Contrary to most partnerships, these conservation partnerships do not use the market as a steering mechanism for sustainable development, but focus on enhancing international policy processes. The article concludes that the partnerships reinvent biodiversity policy and politics, which is necessary to improve the effectiveness of the biodiversity governance system, and that they complement intergovernmental regimes, albeit with varying effectiveness. Recommendations are developed for governments to strategically enhance public-private interaction.© 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. and ERP Environment.

AB  - The possibility to prevent strongyle infection in horses by adding chlamydospores of the nematophagous fungus Duddingtonia flagrans to the feed concentrate has been studied in four groups of Lusitano horses. Two groups were given a daily dosage of 5×10 5 chlamydospores of D. flagrans together with the feed concentrate during 9 weeks: group 1 (G-1) composed of 9 colts maintained under a pasture regime, and group 3 (G-3) composed of adult (3-4 yr) stabled horses with regular access to grazing paddocks located nearby the barn. The other two groups received feed concentrate without spores: group 2 (G-2) composed of 9 grazing foals, and group 4 (G-4) composed of 7 adult stabled horses. Prior to the beginning of the study, the grazing animals were dewormed with a single dose of pyrantel pamoate, and the adult horses (stabled) treated with a dose of ivermectin. The effect of the chlamydospores was assessed by the Faecal Egg Count Reduction (FECR) and the Egg Reappearance Period (ERP). Strongyle-eggs were found in the stools of G-2 and G-4 throughout the study. The egg-shedding was suppressed 1 week after deworming (WAD) in G-3, and 2 WAD in G-1. A 100% FECR value was observed in the G-1 from 2 to 4 WAD, and then reduced to 0%. The FECR values ranged from 100% to 90% in G-3. The ERP was 5 weeks in G-1 and G-3. Significant differences in the FECR were obtained between G-1 and G-2, as well as between G-3 and G-4. Our results demonstrate that addition of D. flagrans spores to the feed concentrate can be useful to reduce the possibility of infection in horses. Further studies are needed to determine the appropriate dosage and frequency of administration of the chlamydospores.

AB  - Subnational governments (such as provinces, states or regions) are largely ignored in international policy documents on sustainable development, and they are not recognized in multilateral decision-making. Nevertheless, many subnational governments have launched sustainable development policies. This article examines to what extent they take global sustainable development governance into account when doing so. The theoretical framework presents two mechanisms of international influence, building mostly upon the policy convergence literature. That framework is then applied on a comparative policy analysis of five subnational governments: North Holland (the Netherlands), North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany), Wallonia (Belgium), Flanders (Belgium) and Quebec (Canada). The findings show that subnational governments with a distinct territorial identity react differently on international trends from other subnational governments. Flanders and Quebec, which have such an identity, follow the rules and decision-making procedures of the international sustainable development regime, and they translate the norms and principles into their policies. The article also finds that the influence of international policies is determined by the active participation of subnational governments in multilateral decision-making. Finally, it is argued that the legitimacy pressures exerted by international organizations on lower-level governments to adopt certain policies have a varying impact on subnational governments dependent on their domestic context. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB  - Degradation of agricultural soils is a serious concern in transition countries in the EU. We investigate similarities and differences between the soil conservation policy frameworks of Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and the former German Democratic Republic and their implementation. Our focus is on the differences in institutional arrangements, i.e. formally existing policies, property rights, informal institutions and governance structures. We conducted comparative case studies based on a framework of institutional analysis, using literature survey, document analysis and in-depth stakeholder interviews. Results show that among the determining factors for policy effectiveness are property rights regimes and land-use rights, traditions in the provision of advisory services, farmers' previous experience with soil conservation practices and policies, perceived threat of enforcement, and trust in administrative authorities. We conclude that the existence of similar legislation and a common policy framework does not guarantee similar outcomes because institutional arrangements and their evolution play a major role in the effectiveness of agricultural soil conservation policies. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB  - Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is characterized by an intense preoccupation with a perceived or imagined defect. Although scientific treatment literature supports the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral treatment, few systematic studies have been conducted to date. We evaluated the systematic application of a combination of cognitive therapy and behavior therapy, specifically exposure and response prevention (ERP), and compared it to a regime of only ERP to assess whether the addition of cognitive therapy improves treatment response. A total of 10 participants were randomly assigned to two treatment conditions. Participants either received four weeks of cognitive treatment followed by four weeks of in vivo ERP or eight weeks of in vivo ERP alone. Treatment was conducted on an intensive basis, with individual sessions held three times a week for 90 minutes for a total of 24 sessions in eight weeks. At midpoint, four weeks of cognitive or behavioral therapy (12 sessions) resulted in significant improvements on measures of overall BDD symptoms, anxiety, and depression, but not on satisfaction with various body parts, maladaptive appearance beliefs, and social distress. At posttreatment, results indicated that ERP was equally effective as a combination of cognitive and behavior therapy. At eight weeks significant improvement was noted on all measures except satisfaction with various body parts and quality of life. It appears that eight weeks of treatment is better than four, and that cognitive therapy does not enhance treatment outcome. Recommendations for future research evaluating variables which influence treatment outcome are discussed. © 2011 International Association for Cognitive Psychotherapy.

AB  - Research indicates that impairment of working memory may be one of the factors that impede the ability to read fluently and accurately. Although the capacity of working memory is traditionally considered to be constant, recent data point to a certain plasticity in the neural system that underlies working memory, which can be improved by training. We examined whether dyslexic readers' recall span and speed of processing in working memory can be increased, enhancing the quality of their reading. Thirty five skilled readers and twenty six dyslexic readers were trained in working memory tasks and compared to control groups of fifteen skilled and fifteen dyslexic readers who complete a self-paced reading training regime. All subjects were trained over a six-week period. Reading and working memory indicators were collected before and after the two trainings. Brain activity using measures of event-related potential (ERP) were collected for the working memory training groups by using a working memory task (Sternberg task). Result indicated after working memory training the ability to store verbal and visual-spatial information in working memory increased, and decoding, reading rate and comprehension scores improved in both groups, although the gap between the dyslexic and the control groups in reading and working memory scores remained constant. The latency of the P300 component decreased and the amplitude increased in all participants following training. No training effect in any parameter was obtained in the self-paced reading training groups. These findings support the notion of plasticity in the neural system underlying working memory and point to the relationships between larger working memory capacity and enhancement of reading skills. © 2010.

AB  - This article provides an evidence-based and policy-relevant contribution to understanding the phenomenon of policy learning and its structural constraints in the field of river basin management, in particular related to coping with current and future climatic hazards such as floods and droughts. This has been done by a formal comparative analysis of eight water management regimes, by using multi-value qualitative comparative analysis, focusing on the relationship between regime characteristics (as explanatory variables) and different levels of policy learning (as output value). This research has revealed the importance of the socio-cognitive dimension, as an essential emerging property of complex adaptive governance systems. This socio-cognitive dimension depends on a specific set of structural conditions; in particular, better integrated cooperation structures in combination with advanced information management are the key factors leading towards higher levels of policy learning. Furthermore, this research highlights a number of significant positive correlations between different regime elements, thereby identifying a stabilizing mechanism in current management regimes, and this research also highlights the necessity of fine-tuning centralized control with bottom-up approaches. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB  - This paper employs smooth transition autoregressive (STAR) models to investigate the nonlinear dynamic behavior of exchange rate deviations based on the exchange rate parity (ERP) theory in four Asian economies: Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore. In this study, quarterly data from 1978 Q1 through 2007 Q4 are analyzed. The empirical results indicate that the deviations in the exchange rate of all four countries reject the null of linearity. The rate deviations in the Japanese and Korean cases exhibit a dynamic and smoothly symmetric ESTAR type process, while those in the Taiwanese and Singaporean cases match the smoothly asymmetric LSTAR type with respect to depreciating and appreciating regimes. These nonlinear characteristics can be explained by the existence of heterogeneous behavior and asymmetric information among economic agents. Furthermore, the estimation results of a nonlinear least squares (NLS) regression indicate that most of the parameter estimates are significant at the 10 percent level. The forecasted Japanese and Korean rate deviations in the ESTAR model are not superior to those from the AR model, possibly because these two countries experienced a serious fluctuation during the Asian financial crisis that occurred in 1997. However, based on the criterion of the RMSE, the forecasted Taiwanese and Singaporean rate deviations in the LSTAR model outperform those in the AR model. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Over the last two million years, humans have colonized almost the entire biosphere on Earth, thereby creating socio-ecological systems in which fundamental patterns and processes are co-regulated by socio-economic and ecological processes. We postulate that the evolution of coupled socio-ecological systems can be characterized by a sequence of relatively stable configurations, here denoted as 'socio-metabolic regimes', and comparatively rapid transitions between such regimes. We discern three fundamentally different socio-metabolic regimes: hunter-gatherers, agrarian societies and industrial society. Transitions between these regimes fundamentally change socio-ecological interactions, whereas changes and variations within each regime are gradual. Two-thirds of the world population are currently within a rapid transition from the agrarian to the industrial regime. Many current global sustainability problems are a direct consequence of this transition. The central hypothesis discussed in this article is that industrial society is at least as different from a future sustainable society as it is from the agrarian regime. The challenge of sustainability is, therefore, a fundamental re-orientation of society and the economy, not the implementation of some technical fixes. Based on empirical data for global resource use (material and energy flows, land use), this essay questions the notion that the promotion of eco-efficiency is sufficient for achieving sustainability, and outlines the reasons why a transition to a new socio-metabolic regime is now required. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. and ERP Environment.

AB  - This paper explores the factors associated with voluntary decisions to assure social, environmental and sustainability reports. Since the market for assurance services in this area is in its formative stages, there is a limited understanding of the demand for this emergent non-fi nancial auditing practice, which is evolving rapidly across different countries. Drawing from extant literature in international auditing and environmental accounting, we focus on a set of country-level institutional factors to explain the adoption of sustainability assurance statements among an international panel of 212 Fortune Global 250 companies for the years 1999, 2002 and 2005. Consistent with our expectations, our results provide evidence that companies operating in countries that are more stakeholder oriented and have a weaker governance enforcement regime are more likely to adopt a sustainability assurance statement. Further, the demand for assurance is higher in countries where sustainable corporate practices are better enabled by market and institutional mechanisms. Our exploratory fi ndings also indicate that the likelihood of choosing a large accounting fi rm as assurance provider increases for companies domiciled in countries that are shareholder oriented and have a lower level of litigation. We conclude the paper by suggesting three directions of research in the area of sustainability assurance that have relevant academic and practical implications.

AB  - As the economy becomes global and ICT-reliant, approaches practiced in enterprise software product development and enterprise resource planning (ERP) system implementation must cope with increasingly complex situations induced by contemporary supply chain and regulations. Compliance with regulations in the market is one aspect of the requirements that enterprise software must meet. Recent research of KPMG IT Advisory has confirmed that where little attention is being paid to the value-added tax (VAT) issues during large ERP projects, there is a higher VAT-risk exposure. In a design-oriented approach, we first identify the stakeholders and their interests in the VAT compliance of ERP systems. Enterprise architecture (EA) and model driven engineering in a multi-level perspective serve as the source of solution patterns. The efficient solution of compliance problems builds upon stakeholders utilizing a set of interdependent models and methods that are suitably allocated to the public and proprietary domains. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Poor water governance regimes and the imbalance caused by the increasing demand for water and diminishing supply of water has resulted in severe water scarcity. Consequently, water management authorities across the world face the challenge to ensure that quantity, quality, distribution, and allocation of water among the various uses are sustainable. Therefore, water reuse on a large scale that has been ignored in the past is gaining importance in recent years as a reliable alternative source of water. Nevertheless, successful expansion and integration of water recycling into future sustainable water management plans encounter various impediments such as costs compared to other water sources, public acceptance, minimization of environmental and health impact, and technology to treat water to an appropriate standard. Further, there is an on-going debate on increasing community and private sector involvement to address these problems. In this context, adopting a case study approach this paper discusses the critical success factors (CSFs)-social, institutional, regulatory and policy, financial, technical, and risk-for private sector involvement in wastewater management. The paper also discusses the activities supporting these set of factors, thereby leading to sustainable wastewater management. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article looks at the relationship between economic regulation, environmental regulation, company strategy and the environment in the UK water and sewerage industry. The regulatory field in this industry, following privatization in 1989, is highly complex and interdependent. The paper presents three case studies of company interpretation of and response to changes in this regulatory field, focusing particularly on the third review by the economic regulator, in 1999, which involved a reduction of the prices companies were allowed to charge their customers. This had significant but complex repercussions for environmental strategy and management in the companies, with different impacts on mandatory and non-mandatory activities. It also showed in relief the opportunities for building coalitions between companies and the environmental regulator, both in general terms and revolving around specific, local environmental issues and schemes. Companies' strategic direction was also found to have an impact on their response to the regulatory review. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB  - This paper addresses the problems of institutional changes in governance and the framing of biodiversity conservation policy at the level of the enlarged European Union. The current development of European Union governance has become more complex and multilevel, partially usurping competences from the central state and relying on networks of interconnected actors rather than on a hierarchy dominated and defined by the state. This shift is particularly challenging for biodiversity governance in new member states, where current decision making is still affected by post-socialist relations and massive ongoing institutional changes, often resulting in inefficient institutional designs and over-exploitation of natural resources. The paper offers a cross-country analysis of fi ve Central and Eastern European countries, characterized by different socialist regimes and different transition processes from hierarchical to democratic and market governance. The theoretical basis of the paper is institutional rebuilding in Central and Eastern Europe in the context of the emerging multilevel environmental governance of the EU. The data were collected from desk study research and interviews. The results show that some elements of multilevel governance existed in these countries prior to the transition, but that EU integration empowered lower levels of self-government. The mismatch between the old hierarchical institutions developed under socialism and the new decentralized institutions introduced during the transformation process still persists and is visible. The emergence of multilevel governance with multiple actors' participation is prone to create tensions, but evidence from the countries studied indicates that this is not necessarily a disadvantage.

AB  - This article examines the key contributions of the political science and systems theory based literatures on environmental governance, and uses them to analyse the governance of biodiversity in Europe. The article suggests that the key insights of the two bodies of literature are a distinction between governance frameworks and regimes on one hand, and the importance of multifaceted and multiple scales on the other. These key insights draw attention to horizontal and vertical forms of interplay. The article suggests that interplay, both between actors and levels and between frameworks and regimes, is ubiquitous and ambivalent: it can either foster or hinder environmental governance. The article illustrates this discussion in the context of governance of biodiversity in Europe, highlighting how vertical and horizontal interplay between the governance framework for biodiversity and the broader institutional setting or regime have characterized the implementation of the Habitats Directive, both complicating and fostering the governance of biodiversity in Europe.

AB  - I address in a comparative perspective the question of whether environmental management systems and particular managerial activities to reduce negative environmental impacts have a positive influence on the probability of' firms carrying out environmental innovations. Based on binary and multinomial discrete choice models, I study the relationship of a number of determinants to the occurrence of environmental innovations based on data from a survey carried out in 2001 in nine European states. I find evidence that environmental management systems are associated with process innovations, but that this is moderated by the interaction of environmental management system implementation with country location. I do not find that environmental management systems are associated with product innovations or that a moderating effect of country location exists. County-specific national cultures and regulatory regimes moderate the association of environmental management system implementation with environmental product and process innovations, respectively.

AB  - In recent years, collaborative planning and processes of social learning (SL) have gained increasingly in interest in river basin management. In this paper, we first summarize the prerequisites for SL to take place in collaborative management processes. These are openness, gains and incentives, and a perceived pressure to learn. We then study the European situation subsequent to the introduction of the European Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC; WFD) as an example. Based on an analysis of policy documents, a case study of the Elbe river basin and an elaboration of concepts related to theories of international regimes, we conclude that the conditions for SL are often not met if management processes are highly formalised. Considering SL that is necessary for innovation and change, this can best be supported through the establishment of parallel "learning processes", such as the Common Implementation Strategy that accompanies implementation of the WFD at European level.

AB  - The extent to which recent changes in industrial development and environmental policies in six countries (Chile, China, Pakistan, Tunisia, Turkey and Zimbabwe) have more closely aligned the objectives of industrial development with those of sustainable development are assessed in this article. The six countries did not make great advances in policy integration in support of sustainable development in the 1990s in terms of policy coordination, cooperation or coherence, but some did better than others. The countries showed considerable variation in the effectiveness with which they implemented their industrial development and environmental policy regimes. Lastly, the impact of industry on sustainable development also varied considerably, depending on which economic, social and environmental parameters were used to assess their contribution.

AB  - This article examines interaction between multilateral agreements and the assessment of implementation efforts. The first aim is to portray how regulations emanating from different international regimes are developed and implemented in an interdependent manner. The second main theme concerns the assessment of implementation measures in a situation of interaction. The focus here is on the high level of interaction between regulations pertaining to genetic resources and technological utilization of these through bioprospecting. Particular attention is given to where authority stems from in this context of multiple and interacting institutions. What is the most legitimate framework for making authoritative decisions on the use of genetic resources? Empirical evidence suggests a dual development. First, norm diffusion through international institutions increasingly plays a legitimizing role in international transactions with genetic resources. At the same time, there is a high correlation between dominating countries and key economic interests in the global economy of life sciences, and these interests wield their authority and power through a different set of institutions.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to analyze the economics of taxing virgin raw materials for environmental reasons. The theoretical discussion is general in scope but empirically we focus on the case of aggregate taxation in three European countries. The motives for environmental taxation of aggregates are mixed, and not all motives find strong support in the economics literature. For instance, the conservation motive may be valid if a relevant market failure can be identified, but, in the presence of a well defined owner of the resource, resource scarcity is often not a sufficient condition for policy intervention. Under some conditions a tax levied per ton of aggregates extracted may be motivated by the presence of environmental externalities at the extraction stage. Still, such a tax provides no direct incentives to reduce the relevant externalities, since the only way of avoiding the tax is to reduce production. In this respect the UK tax appears to be particularly inefficient; it uses one policy instrument to address a number of different environmental externalities at the extraction stage (noise, dust, visual intrusion, loss of amenity and damage to biodiversity), and it is uniform across quarries although the associated externalities are likely to be highly site specific. Overall the paper concludes that taxing output or use typically represents a 'second-best' policy alternative, which could be used when, for instance, the monitoring of non-point-source emissions and/or efficient property rights regimes are hard to implement. The fact that virgin resource taxes often address rather diffuse (not to say unimportant) environmental problems may however make them hard to promote effectively on the political arena.

AB  - Sustainable development is a cross-cutting issue par excellence that necessitates a very high degree of policy coordination. This is especially true considering that the European Union's 2001 Sustainable Development Strategy demands that all European Union (EU) policies actively support the sustainable development of other countries, particularly those in the developing world. In order to fulfil this ambitious obligation, the EU has pledged to consider the impacts that all new policies have within and outside the EU as part of a new impact assessment (IA) regime. This paper aims to evaluate how well the new IA regime has helped address the 'external' dimensions of sustainability through the analysis of potential effects of EU policies on non-EU countries. It finds that the IA procedure does not currently function as an effective instrument for the implementation of the Union's commitment to promoting sustainability in the developing world. Other coordination mechanisms need to be considered, given the horizontal and vertical complexity of this challenge. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB  - German wind power development is a technological success story but has involved very high subsidies. Germany was a latecomer in wind power but specific political conditions in the late 1980s and early 1990s allowed the implementation of the feedin tariff regime, which has characterized Germany ever since. The wind lobby managed to constitute itself at an early stage and to develop stable alliances with farmers and regional policymakers. The concentration of the wind industry in structurally weak regions reinforced these links. With an increased visibility of the subsidies and saturation of onshore sites in the early 2000s, the lobby has been less successful in retaining support. The current attempt to develop offshore projects may suffer from less favourable interest constellations. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB  - This paper analyses whether different emission trading regimes provide different incentives to participate in a cooperative climate agreement. Different incentive structures are discussed for those countries, namely the US, Russia and China, that are most important in the climate negotiation process. Our analysis confirms the conjecture that, by appropriately designing the emission trading regime, it is possible to enhance the incentives to participate in a climate agreement. Therefore, participation and optimal policy should be jointly analysed. Moreover, our results show that the US, Russia and China have different most preferred climate coalitions and therefore adopt conflicting negotiation strategies. © 2004 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB  - Any effective future climate policy regime based on the Kyoto Protocol requires the determination of the concrete contribution regarding time and quantity for each party. Based on the two justice principles, responsibility and equity of rights, that form the basis for the so-called Brazilian Proposal and Contraction and Convergence respectively, a new approach is developed: future emission rights are allocated on the basis of equal emissions per capita over time. By so doing not only are emissions per capita (EPC) taken into account during the allocation but also their evolution over time. This may result in negative quantities of emission rights for some parties due to their historical 'burden'. On the other hand, parties with low EPC would be allocated large amounts of 'fair air'. Even though this approach may currently lack political support by powerful parties, it offers another analytical reference point for the political bargaining process on future allocations. © 2004 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB  - Across Europe, there is considerable interest in establishing stronger links between environmental regulation and standards for environmental management systems (EMSs) such as ISO 14001. If it can be demonstrated that possession of an EMS results in improved environmental or regulatory performance, then there is a case for granting 'regulatory relief' in the form of, for example, reduced inspection frequencies. This paper describes the analysis of information on almost 800 sites regulated under the UK's Integrated Pollution Control regime. It demonstrates that having an EMS improves certain procedural aspects of environmental management but does not appear to reduce the likelihood of breaching permit conditions. Interviews with certification bodies revealed the factors, such as differentiation of services in the market for certification, that underlie this finding. It is concluded that some limited recognition of EMS in regulation is warranted, because there is overlap between some regulatory and certification procedures, and because having an EMS facilitates the supply of information necessary for regulation. The broader implications for regulated industry, certification bodies, regulators and wider environmental policymaking are considered. © 2003 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB  - Participation in the New Zealand fishing industry exists on two levels: quota holding and quota ownership. This study is motivated by the desire to establish whether changes in the number and concentration of quota ownerships and quota holdings have had any impact on the sustainability of fishery in New Zealand. Of the 294 marine species commercially harvested in New Zealand the top 15 by volume and/or value are considered in this paper. Findings indicate that quota ownership and holding have become more concentrated since the inception of the individual transferable quota (ITQ) regimes, with the concentration ratios CR4, CR10 and CR20 all increasing. This suggests that the introduction of the ITQ has not encourage the entry of new market participants; rather the industry has moved toward a single ownership model. Second, this paper establishes trends in the level of total allocable commercial cathc (TACC) over the study period (August 1986-June 2000). Findings suggest that, with one or two interesting exceptions, cathch levels have remained remarkably constant. Prima facie, there appears to have been no adverse impact from structural change on the overall resource sustainability based on TACC. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB  - This paper examines whether policy learning can improve implementation. Our question is whether such policy learning can plausibly be encouraged from the 'top down' and what constraints such a strategy might face. We examine how the relatively weak Irish environmental policy regime has coped with features of the recent Water Framework Directive (2000), that encouraged policy learning. We find these have already produced some policy learning, through greater formal and informal local and national networking. However, signs of policy learning through participation appear weak and too early to discern. Moreover, policy learning through participation appears limited due to the pattern of interest group power. Finally, we see little evidence of change in values, beliefs and preferences, which are confirmed here as slow to change. © 2003 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB  - The analysis of existing emission trading schemes leads to the classification of their characteristics into four categories: (i) objectives, (ii) target groups, (iii) rules-influencing mechanisms and (iv) implementation network. This classification is applied for the design of a Hellenic emissions trading scheme and for exploring policy interactions between the Hellenic scheme and other Hellenic climate policy instruments. The results of this procedure confirm that the proposed classification facilitates the definition of the elementary Hellenic scheme characteristics and the specification of its distinctions from other national regimes. Conclusively the proposed classification systematizes and facilitates the integrated design of an emissions trading scheme. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB  - An original approach to the solution of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) is pursued in this paper, following the regular perturbation (RP) method. Such an iterative method provides a closed-form approximation of the received field and is thus appealing for devising nonlinear equalization/compensation techniques for optical transmission systems operating in the non-linear regime. It is shown that, when the nonlinearity is due to the Kerr effect alone, the order n RP solution coincides with the order 2n + 1 Volterra series solution proposed by Brandt-Pearce and co-workers. The RP method thus provides a computationally efficient way of evaluating the Volterra kernels, with a complexity comparable to that of the split-step Fourier method (SSFM). Numerical results on 10 Gb/s single-channel terrestrial transmission systems employing common dispersion maps show that the simplest third-order Volterra series solution is applicable only in the weakly nonlinear propagation regime, for peak transmitted power well below 5 dBm. However, the insight in the nonlinear propagation phenomenon provided by the RP method suggests an enhanced regular perturbation (ERP) method, which allows the first-order ERP solution to be fairly accurate for terrestrial dispersion-mapped systems up to launched peak powers of 10 dBm.

AB  - In this paper, it is argued that the view of the economic sphere as a closed system cannot appropriately deal with the issue of sustainable development. Evolutionary economics is then presented as a fruitful alternative to apprehend the interactions between the economic, the human and the natural spheres. This emerging field offers both a firm theoretical basis (based upon recent developments in physics, biology, dynamic systems theory and the sciences of complexity) and practical, pragmatic answers to the implementation of a sustainable path of development. This is further illustrated with the presentation of the evolutionary logic of a multi-level common regime. Such a regime could be an institutional counterpart of social and environmental dynamics.

AB  - From the moment the Berlin Wall came down scholars and politicians around the world expressed concern about an upsurge of extreme-right politics in Eastern Europe. Dramatic events like the Yugoslav conflict and even the so-called 'velvet split' of Czechoslovakia only strengthened this fear. Despite these many general warnings about the rise of extreme right parties (ERPs) in Eastern Europe very little empirical work has appeared on the subject. Mudde's article provides an analytical tool which will help to further understanding of the extreme right in the region. It presents and applies a fairly straightforward typology of ERPs in Eastern Europe based on the (ideological) character of the parties. The pre-Communist ERP locates the origin of its ideological identity in political parties and ideas of the pre-Communist period, generally harking back to national-conservative, monarchist, or indigenous or foreign fascist ideals. The character of the party might be expressed in the open espousal of pre-Communist ideas or by using the associated 'folklore', while in some cases there might even be continuity in personnel or organizations (often through the émigré community). With the notable exceptions of Croatia and Slovakia, pre-Communist ERPs have remained marginal in post-Communist political life. The Communist ERP looks for ideological inspiration in the Communist period and includes nationalist splits of the (former) Communist parties as well as new parties that combine a nationalist ideology with a nostalgia for Communist rule. They are mainly successful in countries where the Communist regime had a strong nationalist undercurrent and the party is still in the hands of hardliners (e.g. Romania and Russia). Post-Communist ERPs, finally, locate the source of their identities in the post-Communist period: these organizations are new and their focus is on current political issues. They harbour no feelings of nostalgia, either for the pre-Communist or the Communist period. Post-Communist ERPs have developed in most East European countries but, although some have achieved remarkable electoral successes, in general they have been only moderately successful (similar to ERPs in Western Europe).

AB  - The introduction of genetically modified (GM) crops for commercial planting approval and importation under the European Union's (EU's) regulatory process has led to an increasingly visible political debate over the potential impacts of these crops upon the European agri-environment. The potential impacts of GM crops upon biodiversity and farming in the wider European agri-environment are presented, and related to the gaps in the EU's regulatory regime under Directive 90/220. The current revision of the regulatory Directive 90/220 up to the Common Position stage, as agreed by the Council of Ministers, offers some important changes to the environmental risk assessment of the impact of GM crops upon biodiversity and farming. However, the inclusion of wider socio-economic impacts upon agriculture remains incomplete, and such impacts are likely to remain on the political agenda.

AB  - Five years after the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, the hesitancy of developed countries is turning out to be the main impediment to implementing an effective policy for sustainable development. Alongside the further development of international environmental regimes, setting up national action plans is necessary to close the action-gap in the North. However, this can only succeed if the action plans include binding objectives that can be monitored and evaluated. Current national strategies for sustainable development only meet this criterion in exceptional cases; in most cases only qualitatively and legally nonbinding objectives are included. In the present paper, a suggestion for a cluster of environmental policy targets is put forth, which - using Germany as an example - establishes the sustainability concept at the national level. Particular emphasis is placed on the normative dimension of target setting. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB  - Appearance of the harmonics in the spectrum of artificial emissions generated during heating experiments has been reported earlier. Usually, it relates with square modulation of HF powerful wave and distortion of this time dependence due to characteristic time of electron heating/cooling. In the EISCAT-Heating experiment in November 1993, a quasi-sinusoidal modulation regime was used. Observations show the clear harmonic structure in artificial emissions in this case too. In the present paper we discuss a generation of harmonics of a modulation frequency due to nonlinear dependence of value of the ionosphere conductivity disturbance from effective radiated power (ERP). A numerical model is used for calculations of the spectrum of the integral conductivity disturbance variation as a function of electron density profile and ERP. For the modulation frequency in the range of 1 - 100 Hz, the characteristic time of electron heating/cooling was neglected, and intensity ratios of the second and third harmonics to the fundamental frequency reach 0.4 and 0.15, respectively. For the modulation frequency 1375 Hz, time integration of the electron energy balance equation was used. The different characteristic time constants of the electron heating/cooling at different altitudes make the behavior of the intensity ratio and phase shift of the harmonics of the integral conductivity disturbance variations more complicated. The values of the harmonic amplitude ratio in this case decrease to 0.25 and 0.1.

AB  - Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded to a digit-probe identification and matching task (modified 'Sternberg paradigm') in 29 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and 26 healthy subjects. Our main aim was to identify the neurophysiological correlates of abnormal short term memory function in patients with TLE. Neuropsychological tests allowed the definition and comparison of two patient groups according to the presence or absence of memory dysfunction. These two groups did not differ significantly in mean age, education years, IQ, seizure duration, seizure frequency, anti-epileptic drug (AED) regimes, or on findings on neuroimaging. ERPs recorded under different levels of memory load were analysed both by conventional component identification and by an objective computer method of determining mean amplitudes of multiple 50 ms epochs (MMA analysis). We found that some significant abnormalities were common to both groups of patients; these included slow reaction times, a reduced amplitude of the N170 wave (and the corresponding 157-210 ms epoch in the MMA analysis) and a broad late negative shift between 577 and 735 ms. Other findings, including a significantly reduced performance accuracy as the level of memory load increased, were restricted to patients with abnormal memory function. The ERP changes that were specific to these patients occurred within a latency band of 200-420 ms and included a relatively preserved, but delayed P250 component and a delayed and attenuated N290 wave. When compared with either healthy subjects or with patients with normal memory, the responses in patients with abnormal memory showed an abnormal 'positive shift' between 262 and 315 ms after probe presentation and a further positive shift between 315 and 420 ms as memory load increased. These abnormalities of 'memory scanning' ERPs in patients with TLE which paralleled neuropsychological and behavioural evidence of memory dysfunction, and which occurred in the section of the response that is sensitive to memory loading in healthy subjects, provide further objective evidence-that abnormalities of short term memory processes contribute to the memory deficits of TLE.

AB  - Electronic toll collection (ETC) offers the opportunity for toll facility operators to supply a substantially greater amount of traffic capacity than any other currently available form of toll collection. The current interest in ETC derives from the proposals in a number of countries to introduce urban tollways, using the net toll receipts to recover the cost of the capital investment plus an acceptable profit margin for those taking the financial risk. This paper outlines the main economic, technical, and administrative features of ETC in the context of toll charges that are determined by the rules of capital cost recovery. Electronic road pricing (ERP) as a mechanism for implementing full road user charging (in line with economic principles of efficient use of road space) is not the topic of this paper, given the predominantly financial basis of setting tolls for private roads. The underlying rationale for toolroads in the political climate of most nations is not suggestive of any plan to revise the pricing regime in line with ERP upon reversion of the infrastructure to the public sector when the capital costs are repaid. It is assumed that the tollroads will revert to free roads in line with the existing road system, and that road users will continue to contribute towards the costs of maintaining the road system by the traditional pricing mechanisms (i.e. fuel taxes, vehicle registration, fees, etc.). © 1991.

AB  - Compound field potentials were recorded with up to 18 microelectrodes in comb, brush, or spear arrays on and in the optic tectum and with suction electrodes from the distal stump of the cut optic nerve and from the optic nerve head in the opened eye in elasmobranchs and teleosts. Diffuse light flashes of different durations and submaximal intensities were delivered in trains with regular or irregular interstimulus intervals (ISI). Event-related potentials (ERPs) are visible in single trials and begin at 50-200 ms after an 'oddball' flash, especially one that is slightly weaker, briefer, or delayed by as little as 6% of ISI, compared with the more frequent stimulus. ERPs to the opposite condition are not of the same form or size. One or more stimuli were omitted from a train or the train terminated after various conditioning times. Deflections occur beyond the expected visual-evoked potentials (VEPs) to the last flash and are called omitted-stimulus potentials (OSPs). They occur on schedule-~100 ms after the next flash would be due-almost independent of intensity, duration, or conditioning time. They are considered to be ERPs without any necessary implication or denial of a temporally specific expectation. Three components of OSP occur alone or in combination: an initial fast peak, a slow wave, and an oscillatory spindle up to 1s or more in duration. This resembles the OFF response to steady light. All these components are already present in the retina with optic nerve cut. The same mean ISI with a high proportion of jitter gives OSPs with only slightly longer latencies and smaller amplitudes; the OSP acts as though the retina makes an integrated prediction of ISI, intensity, and duration. During a conditioning train the equilibrium between excitation and inhibition after each flash changes according to frequency, intensity, duration, and conditioning time; the VEP reflects this in a shape unique to the ISI; inhibition increases rapidly after each flash and then decays slowly according to the recent mean ISI. This allows rebound disinhibition after missing, weak, or delayed flashes (OSP or ERP) or causes an altered VEP after a longer or stronger oddball. It seems unlikely that the OSP or oddball ERP in fish tectum is equivalent to mammalian ERPs under the same regime or signals higher cognitive events, because they are already present in the retina, require flash frequencies >1 Hz, and grow with frequency up to and beyond flicker fusion. The possibility, even in mammals, that some ERP components are rebounds or the like, at lower precognitive levels, must be considered. Low-level sensory ERPs can have long latency, complex forms, with evoked rhythmicities, and can integrate stimulus history over many seconds.

AB  - A primary health care (PHC) strategy was adopted in Ghana in 1978, but the civilian government at the time failed to implement the program designed to achieve health for all Ghanaians. In 1982, the revolutionary military government under Rawlings indicated its commitment to the full implementation of the PHC program. In this article, the author seeks to examine the extent to which the Economic Recovery Program initiated by the Rawlings' regime, its policy of decentralization and mobilization of the masses, and its promise to institute some fundamental organizational and structural changes in the health care delivery system, are contributing to the process of achieving 'health for all' Ghanaians.
The extent to which the Economic Recovery Program contributes to the process of achieving "health for all" Ghanians by the year 2000 is examined. In 1982, the military government committed itself to the full implementation of the Primary Health Care (PHC) program in Ghana. To mobilize masses of people, the Rawling's government established Workers and People's Defense Committees. Clean-up campaigns were organized by these committees. However, the past 3 years have seen little of these campaigns. The government intends to create District Assemblies to provide the means to facilitate the mobilization of local resources, the participation of local people in health-related activities, and the functioning of PHC. The Rawling's government launched its Economic Recovery Program (ERP) in January, 1983. The 1st stage of the ERP aimed at lowering the inflation rate, increasing food and raw material production, and improving the distribution of goods, services and income. The government has begun a radical change in foreign exchange policy. There is reason to fear for the health of Ghanians, especially the children. User fees have been introduced for all public health care facilities, thus reducing the accessibility of public health care services for the low income population. Rawling's health policy is designed to emphasize the need for change in the country's health care delivery system to support the PHC program. The general framework of the PHC program in Ghana is based on a 3-tier health care system. Several problems contribute to the failure of the successful implementation of PHC, resulting in poor health conditions in Ghana.
