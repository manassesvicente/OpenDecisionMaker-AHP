AB  - This study examines stock market reactions to investments in enterprise resource planning and enterprise application integration technologies, using signaling theory concepts as explaining theory. The empirical results presented in this paper indicate that financial markets differentiate among technologies that companies invest in to integrate their information systems. In addition, this study confirms that technology maturity, financial health of the investing company, and stock market conditions are important factors influencing the stock market reaction. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The demand and support for enterprise applications integration (EAI) in Nigeria was investigated. The findings show that the demand and support for EAI are driven by a number of factors, including concern for data/information integration, a common interface for all enterprise applications, improved communication and faster data transfer, real-time data capture and access to information across various networks, as well as data and information integrity across various systems. The IT companies in Nigeria are following the progress of technology and are poised to respond to it in their approaches to EAI solutions. Their future approaches will be influenced to the greatest extent by progress in Graphical User Interface (GUI) and then by developments in Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Operating Systems, Software as a Service (SaaS), Parameterization of applications for easy customization, Applications Service Provision, and Open Source Systems in that order. They believe that Nigeria has the greatest capacity in Software as a Service (SaaS) and Software as Secured Service (SaSS). A growing number of companies are using open source tools in developing and implementing EAI solutions, and this is an indication of a market that is taking on its own character but also a subscription to the democratization of software access. The popularity of SQL Server and its varieties, closely followed by Oracle and Java/Javascript, as EAI tools in Nigeria is probably a reflection of their prominence on the international scene. © The Author(s) 2013.

AB  - Population growth and the environment is now a major discussion issue. Most cases of excessive preference for a larger family size are involved with environmental degradation in developing countries. Moreover, rural or indigenous people living in forest areas have a regular interaction with the environment. They usually depend on environmental resources for subsistence. The main objective of this study is to analyze indigenous people's perception of the relationship between environment and fertility. Out of the seven Khasia villages, the village called Lawachora Punji, with 23 households, was included in the field survey. The research findings reveal that environmental awareness is higher among women and the overall index is relatively low in the indigenous people regarding the environmental and demographic aspects. The overall environmental awareness index (EAI) indicates that people living in Lawachora National Park do not have a strong understanding of the impact of large family size on the environment. Grassroots level participation and gradual change of perception of large family size and dependence on forest resources are important to environmental sustainability in developing countries. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB  - This paper, based on a cross-sectional empirical study of information system (IS) architectures within 143 small to medium enterprises (SMEs) in France, reports findings on how SMEs architect to achieve IS integration and interoperability. This research provides an empirically derived taxonomy of enterprise architectural variants of the types often described in the literature for large firms. This study finds indications that for SMEs the immediate goal of interoperability prevailed over fuller and more formal system integration. The most common means for approaching enterprise architecture and any form of integration is via the construction of software bridges and interfaces. Partially standardized architectures based on Enterprise Systems (ERP) are the next most common type. Hybrid architectures- mixed Enterprise Applications Integration and ERP- are the third most common. The contribution of this paper lies not in the identification of the three types but resides (1) in the description of their distribution in SMEs; (2) in the absence of other integration/interoperability types in this population; and (3) most importantly in the interpretation of the organizational and historical rationale explaining the emergence of these types in this organizational context. © 2012 Operational Research Society Ltd.

AB  - Rapid advances in industrial information integration methods have spurred tremendous growth in the use of enterprise systems. Consequently, a variety of techniques have been used for probing enterprise systems. These techniques include business process management, workflow management, Enterprise Application Integration (EAI), Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), grid computing, and others. Many applications require a combination of these techniques, which is giving rise to the emergence of enterprise systems. Development of the techniques has originated from different disciplines and has the potential to significantly improve the performance of enterprise systems. However, the lack of powerful tools still poses a major hindrance to exploiting the full potential of enterprise systems. In particular, formal methods and systems methods are crucial for modeling complex enterprise systems, which poses unique challenges. In this paper, we briefly survey the state of the art in the area of enterprise systems as they relate to industrial informatics. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - The IEEE Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology defines integration as "the process of combining software components, hardware components, or both, into an overall system". True enterprise integration refers to integrating structural changes, different behaviors, and various information systems in an enterprise. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) has laid tremendous amount of focus on integration of internal business functions and processes traditionally. Modern enterprises are required to regulate both internal and external business processes by integrating the heterogeneous applications found spread throughout an enterprise. A contemporary approach for streamlining business processes while exposing the diverse and disparate applications found spread throughout the enterprise in a highly standardized manner is embodied by (Web) services that can be easily assembled to form a collection of autonomous and loosely coupled business processes. The emergence of Web services developments and standards in support of automated business integration has given rise to the service-oriented architecture (SOA). SOA is a present day emerging approach. Software resources in the form of explicitly defined services are made available by virtue of this approach within the enterprise network. A key aspect of implementing an SOA is to provide a loosely coupled integration platform that will allow specific application instances to change and evolve without affecting the central integration technology itself. This paper is based on a survey done focusing the various techniques and best practices available for performing Business-to- Business integration, and thus providing a comprehensive look into a choice of offered approaches from traditional ERP to contemporary SOA.© EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.

AB  - In this paper, we present an approach for the implementation of semantically enriched services in Enterprise Application Integration (EAI). We present an integration platform based on a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) which consists of a service registry, a process designer and a run-time engine. There are some additional components for realizing semantic enrichment of services and composed processes e.g. the semantic profiler and the Ontology. The focus of the paper is the preparation for the process run-time. We propose a mediator bases approach Where data transformations are assigned to each service during the deployment. The standard services of ERP, CRM, SCM etc. systems are encapsulated into mediator services which makes possible to apply them in a semantic integration framework. Still, created semantic services remain compatible with current Web service standards and communicate with standard SOAP messages. Hence the collaborative processes composed by attached semantic meta-information of services are also executable by standard Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) run-time engine.

AB  - During the past decade, many enterprises have been re-directing their resources into critical business areas to keep up with economic and market changes. They have adopted electronic business (EB) systems, such as supply chain management, enterprise resource planning (ERP), and enterprise application integration (EAI), to ensure seamless integration with internal processes as well as suppliers and customers. This phenomenon indicates that EB systems are playing an important role in attaining the effectiveness of enterprise operations. However, there is a constant complaint from recruiters that EB professionals with the right skills are hard to come by. To gauge the rapid changes in EB education and industry demand, EB curricula from top universities and job announcements from popular career Web sites in both the US and Taiwan are collected. We analyze the data and compare the results between the two countries to recommend remedial actions for narrowing the gap between industry and academia. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In improving global business economics, business integration has become a key issue for many companies to extend business market by integrating and streamlining processes both internally and with partners, cost effectively. To address this issue, whole marketplace has emerged for efficient software solution that can help to achieve improved business integration for improving global business economics, which is referred as EAI. Originally EAI was only focused around integrating ERP with other applications within enterprise but now it is generally used as a catch-all term to cover all the other aspects of global business integration. Major EAI approaches and evolution of enabling technologies ranging from EDI to Web Services and XML-based process integration are analyzed to provide cost effective, flexible, scalable and adaptable global EAI framework. Solution comprises the challenge of efficiently integrating diverse business processes and data across the enterprises to improve global business economics, while allowing the organizations to keep pace with and respond to market changes. © 2007 - IOS Press and the authors.

AB  - Enterprise application integration (EAI) focuses on the collaboration and interconnection of various information systems, so the basic problem to be solved is how EAI guarantees that the applications will produce consistent presentation of data, message and transaction. The metadata methodology may give us certain good ideas. First, the metadata description method of manufacturing information resource, transaction process and message delivery is put forward on the basis of operation analysis of manufacturing-oriented EAI, and then the tree-structured XML schema of corresponding object is built and a framework of metadata application in the discrete Manufacturing-Oriented EAI is established. Finally, a practical enterprise information integration system in Shanghai Tobacco Machine Co., Ltd. is presented as an example to show how it functions. © 2007 The Second Academy of China Aerospace Science & Industry Cooperation.

AB  - Dynamic Web Services discovery has taken more and more important role in enterprise application integration. So how to find the most accurate services becomes research focus nowadays. In this paper, we put forward a novel matching mechanism based on structural information of services besides on syntax and semantics. The structural information is viewed as the invocation sequence of a series of services performing the users' task defined as Service Graph which makes service discovery and composition issue as graph isomorphism and matching problem. Finally we provide a novel Web Services discovery framework based on syntactic, Service Graph and semantic matching to find the exact services that meets the users' goal.

AB  - This paper investigates the potential of the Semantic Web technologies to support a semantic-based Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) standards architecture. We give detailed information of the support that these technologies and the underlying Description Logics (DL) formalism provide for the integration task. Our main aim is to assess the potential impact of these emerging technologies on industrial interoperability efforts. In addition to that effect, we plan to use this advanced EAI standards architecture as an experimental framework in which the Semantic Web technologies are evaluated on realistic enterprise integration problems. We illustrate novel capabilities beyond the existing syntactic integration approaches when managing multiple enterprise ontologies derived from a common ontology.

AB  - Purpose - Enterprise application integration (EAI) aims to integrate various enterprise applications, such as legacy systems, enterprise resource planning systems, and best-of-breed business applications, to aid in promoting organizational goals. EAI is a relatively new area of concern for researchers and practitioners and research on its adoption by organizations remain to be examined. Design/methodology/approach - This paper extends prior research by providing a systematic examination of both generic and specific dimensions of facilitators and inhibitors for the adoption of EAI technology. A rigorous validation of these factors was established. A case study was conducted to refine the developed instrument. Findings - The results indicate that EAI adoption is facilitated by generic as well as specific factors to this technology. Research limitations/implications - Several limitations of the study need to be mentioned at this stage. First, the research design of this study has incorporated only one site to examine and enrich the list of facilitators and inhibitors of EAI adoption. It is not known whether these results would apply to other organizations, other technologies and whether the project size has some influence on the results. More empirical work is needed to increment the developed instrument. The results of this study have three specific implications for future research. First, this study can be replicated to examine the effect of these facilitators on EAI project performance. Second, more research can be conducted to validate dimensions identified in this study. A survey may strengthen the validation process of the developed instrument and the structure of the dimensions and constructs used. Finally, the results of this study and the developed instrument can be applied on other technologies such as web services, etc. Practical implications - The paper extends King and Teo's list to include EAI-specific factors. Second, it validates the instrument through the card sorting procedure and a case study. The identified dimensions can be used in future research on EAI adoption. The results have also important managerial implications. Managers who are planning to adopt EAI technology can use the developed instrument to assess systematically the facilitators and inhibitors of this technology in their organizational context. Originality/value - This study extends and accumulates on Teo's framework for inhibitors and facilitators of IT adoption in the EAI context. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose - The paper seeks to review the factors and methods used to integrate multiple ERP systems to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOA) in an EAI environment focusing on the SAP business warehouse application. Design/methodology/approach - The paper examines earlier research, surveys, actual processes and documentation defined in the SAP system as well as information gathered from developers, auditors and compliance experts. Findings - To comply with the SOA, it is advisable to look to the area of EAI for assistance. The challenge of configuring a landscape to comply with the SOA without EAI means that most of the links for data transfer would be interfaces versus integration, which is not acceptable to compliance groups. For SOA requirements, including internal controls, testing, security, authorisations and consistency and speeds, there are tools to help successfully achieve the goal of IT compliance in the SAP environment. Research limitations/implications - As SOA continues to take shape, further review and investigation of how these changes will affect the EAI environment must be undertaken. Practical implications - The paper provides the realisation that achieving SOA compliance is not an easy task, and that the available technology must be used to complete this task. IT must structure a governing organisation similar to that found on the applications side of the system to comply with the SOA. Originality/value - With the passing and implementation of the SOA, companies are experiencing additional pressure to develop the means to constantly audit themselves internally. As technology is the key to achieving this goal, organisations must prepare their IT infrastructures to support compliance and the IT departments to develop strategy. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Some Enterprise Architectures and Information Systems frameworks can be used to model different aspects of Enterprise Application Integration (EAI). Considering several of these frameworks and in particular the approaches proposed by the Brown's Conceptual Model of Integration and the Integration Views of Sandoe, we have defined an EAI Framework (EAIF), expressed as a standard UML model. Its main contributions are on one hand, to unify concepts and terminology related to integration aspects and on the other hand to model the main features related with processes, services, mechanisms and people involved in business integration. Moreover, EAIF can be used within the enterprise to help integration project managers. The main goals of this work are: - present the EAIF specification, which complements the standard UML model, and - experiment the modeling of the processes, services, mechanisms and people of a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system using the specification to illustrate the EAIF instantiation process. The application to the case study allowed the detection of inconsistencies in the definition of some of the CRM integration processes and the corresponding services suggesting changes in business strategies.

AB  - It is widely understood that both Information Technology (IT) and Information Systems (IS), provide great benefits in improving the visibility of supply and value chains within and across organisational boundaries. Those enterprises which can realise the benefits of extending their core business processes outwards to clients and trading partners, will be able to create unique supply chain-dependent products and solutions. Thus, such business infrastructures have enabled organisations to expand and improve the effectiveness of their enterprise. One method to achieve this, has been to integrate Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems with web-based and other IS systems, using Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) technologies. This paper seeks to investigate those factors which contributed to a case organisation's extended enterprise experiences, by using extant ERP and EAI implementation IS evaluation criteria; and by placing the research results within the context of applicable IS research techniques in the area.

AB  - In the global chemical industry it is of crucial importance to keep an up-to-date knowledge map of customers and providers in order to minimize supply chain inefficiencies. ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) involves coordinating and integrating applications both, within and among companies. In this way, there is a centralized database to manage all the corporate information (financial, production or inventory). This paper describes the architecture of the integrate application and the development of the EBI (Electronic Business Integrator) to connect the Elemica network and SAP (Systems, Applications and Products in Data Processing) servers, market leader in this area. EBI is an integration tool of business applications (Enterprise Application Integration, EAI) based in the ESB technology (Enterprise Service Bus), oriented to the intra and inter company business processes. Elemica is a global network of industrial sectors, including worldwide chemical and pharmaceutical companies, created to expand ERP, which key advantages are connectivity, neutrality and security. SAP is an ERP platform software widely use to have an integrated overview of the business and help to take strategic decisions. The system performance was tested with different scenarios, all including logistic processes: integration of filial companies, relationships of different companies operating ant the same site and integration of pharmaceutical companies. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Purpose - Online, on-demand and real-time availability of information to all members of a manufacturing system enables them to be agile and in the best position to react quickly, efficiently, synchronously, and collectively to the changing market. This paper proposes an integrated web-based logistics management system for agile supply demand network design (ASDN). Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents a software system, which is distributed as open source. A case study of ABB Company in Finland has been undertaken and this demonstrates the validity of ASDN in designing and managing supply demand networks. Findings - Current software applications, such as ERP, WMS and EAI do not support a higher-level decision making. There are several performance measures, which are directly connected to structure of the network. Practical implications - The presented software supports modeling, analyzing and limited optimizing of supply demand networks. Also discussed is the network level logistics analysis that is behind the modeling tool. Originality/value - The paper introduces the ASDN software, which is freely available for research and commercial uses. The case example shows how this type of network architecture-related decisions can be analyzed. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - One crucial issue of content-based Pub/Sub systems is the content-based event matching. The existing approaches that utilize simple constraints to match the contents of events are not enough. For example, in the enterprise application integration scenarios, the event matching is often 'many-to-one' matching or 'one-to-many' matching. Therefore, traditional matching approaches should be extended to solve the complex matching problems. After analyzing information matching patterns in enterprise application integration, three matching models are proposed, the simple matching is extended to the multi-semantic matching, and the temporal constraint variable is introduced. The operations differ in accordance with the different semantics; the discrete events are supported by the temporal constraint variable. Then, OBDD graphs are extended into hierarchy colored OBDD graphs and the equality of the transformation is further proved. Based on the extended OBDD graphs, the composite matching algorithms are presented and analyzed. Experiments show that the proposed algorithms are effectual.

AB  - The use of a combined e-business, enterprise application integration and business process management IT platform for automated EDI transactions, is discussed. Ideal Standard needed a system capable of integrating new partners and distributers easily in terms of their IT, sustaining ongoing growth and providing a single interface for dealing with customer demands. For the company to respond faster to market changes and customer requirements, it also had to deal with some internal integration, particularly around data verification and mapping into ideal standard's global SAP ERP systems. The solution was first installed in Italy, then across France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the UK on the customer side, which is in time and within budget. The Ideal Standard is now working on the supply side initially with four vendors and is aiming to get the top 20 suppliers on the system.

AB  - Most companies in tooling industry position themselves as partners of large companies and operate in a made-to-order fashion. As the product lifecycle is becoming short, the time for tooling companies to design and produce tools shrinks remarkably. To survive in such a competitive market, many tooling companies are seeking solutions to shorten their entire business cycle by improving their working efficiency and productivity with effective collaboration. This paper presents a collaborative engine, capable of supporting horizontal and vertical integration by providing a computer-supported collaborative environment. The engine has been modeled and designed as a foundation for the development of collaborative environments for tooling companies to improve business performance by enhancing internal collaboration, maximizing information sharing and reuse, and seamlessly linking business activities. A collaborative design environment has been prototyped to demonstrate the efficiency of the engine. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether business process integration is feasible. Design/methodology/approach - This paper employs a single case study strategy to research the aforementioned research question. The case study is exploratory. Findings - Based on the findings and within the context of the case organisation, it appears that enterprise application integration (EAI) technology can integrate business processes. However, since it is not possible to generalize from a single case study, further research is suggested to investigate this area. From the case study, it appears that EAI can easily integrate the business processes when it is combined with enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. Research limitations/ implications - This is a single case study and thus the results cannot be generalized. Practical implications - The empirical date suggest that organisations may combine ERP with EAI to integrate their business processes in a more flexible way. Originality/value - The contribution of the paper is threefold: it describes the business process automation layer of EAI technology, it defines and presents a stage model for the business process integration and it examines the research question. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Message-oriented Middleware (MOM), which has flexible methods and efficient way to exchange messages among different organizations, is widely used for heterogeneous application integration in enterprise. A secure message oriented middleware means a protected environment to exchange messages. In other words, messages should be confidentiality, integrity, as well as non-repudiation and only those authorized applications can have them. Although MOM has been widely adopted in enterprise environments, security issues were not noticed in the past. Most MOM products only provide the encrypted functions and leave application developers security operations. Developers have to use those functions to archive authentication, authorization and message encryption by themselves. It increases development effort. This paper proposes an adaptive architecture to create secure message oriented middleware. The security functions can be applied into MOM dynamically to fulfill different security requirement. Those security functions are packed as module and be adapted into MOM. Moreover, developers can only write simple configurations to manipulate those functions instead of modifying programs. It will become easy to develop secure MOM applications.

AB  - To integrate separate resources in different environments, this paper comes out when mobile computing is applied in manufacturing industry. As new enterprise application integration (EAI) technology, Web services can well integrate different enterprise applications including legacy systems and make enterprise resource planning (ERP) system be more open. The process of designing and developing an open ERP system with mobile computing is presented, and the case of the ERP system based on Web services in a locomotive and rolling stock works is given as an example. This open ERP system mainly uses Web services technology to solve the problem of system integration between different environments. Meanwhile, the realization of it by simple object access protocol (SOAP) is illustrated.

AB  - The integration of heterogeneous information systems has always been problematic in health-care organizations, as it is associated with the delivery of key services and has high operational costs. Therefore, health-care organizations are looking for new means to increase their functional capabilities and reduce integration cost. In addressing this need, enterprise application integration (EAI) technology has emerged to facilitate systems integration, enhance the quality of services, and reduce integration costs. Despite the application of EAI in other sectors, its adoption in health care is slow. In seeking to build on the limited normative research surrounding EAI, the authors of this paper focus on the evaluation of factors that influence EAI adoption in the health-care sector. In doing so, using fuzzy cognitive mapping as a technique to identify causal interrelationships among the EAI adoption factors. This approach will enhance the quality of the evaluation process and emphasizes the importance of each factor and its interrelationship with other factors.

AB  - Recent advancements in science and technology provide many competitive advantages to modern businesses. During the 1990s Dow Chemical Company revamped its business strategy and employed e-business. It introduced online business application over the World Wide Web and initiated partnership programmes with all its suppliers and customers. It connected with the B2B market places in the chemical industry like elemica.com and chemconnect.com. Dow also implemented 24/7 customer service, CRM/e-CRM programmes, etc. Once these applications were in place, Dow soon required a state-of-the-art IT security system and addressed this issue by implementing a high standard Cyber security system for its e-business based on the Chemical Sector Cyber Security Program. This paper analyses the Dow Chemical Company's successful implementation of e-business and security systems and provides insight into the future trends of e-business, m-business and beyond.

AB  - Many organizations manage and maintain a diverse portfolio of information system (IS) applications. The integration of these applications is often necessary to support broader enterprise-wide business solutions such as e-business, automated supply chain management (SCM), customer relationship management (CRM) and enterprise resource planning (ERP). Enterprise application integration (EAI) is one approach to IS application integration. The paper presents a case study of an integration project at Harmond Bank where an EAI approach was used to integrate the IS applications in its home loans division. The case-study highlights many of the management and architectural decisions that are pertinent to IS application integration projects, and lessons learned from the case are discussed.

AB  - To coordinate versions of multiple application systems in enterprise application integration processes, a version coordination model supporting multiple applications integration was proposed. In this model, the coordination relationships among application systems were described formally through directed graphs. Based on this model, a valid version coordination detection mechanism and algorithm were provided. Finally, this method was validated through a case. The results indicated advantages of the proposed approach for enterprise application integration domain.

AB  - Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) is a major problem confronting manufacturing organizations that have deployed large-scale enterprise information systems and aim to coordinate inter- and intraorganizational product development, supply-chain, and customer management activities. Successful EAI is a key enabling step toward implementation of viable Product Life-cycle Management (PLM) strategies. Extant EAI technologies, such as distributed object and messaging technologies for communication and ontology-based database schema integration, are tedious to develop and maintain in an organization. Though workflow management systems have enabled process coordination of both manual and system-oriented tasks in organizations, coping with the lack of adaptability and inter-operability in workflow systems is a manual and resource intensive effort. Recent advances in (i) standardized, modular, and distributed software delivery frameworks, such as web services; (ii) standard semantic markup languages for developing domain ontologies; and (iii) intelligent process coordination frameworks promise the development of flexible, responsive, integrated, and organic process management architectures. In this paper, we present an intelligent mediator-based architecture for enabling EAI. Intraorganizational information sources and services are made available via a web-services framework. An Integrated Service Planning and Execution (ISP&E) framework interleaves service composition and execution at the mediator to fulfill service requests. Processes that interleave information gathering and transactional tasks are generated using domain-independent Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) AI planning and a domain-specific ontology and then executed in a scalable and reliable manner. Benefits and limitations of mediator-based frameworks for EAI and topics for further research are discussed based on a prototype development experience.

AB  - This study proposes an implementation process model for integrating eXtensible Markup Language (XML) into enterprise applications, which also meets the inter-organization data exchange standard of RosettaNet. This model is motivated by the Manufacturing Execution System (MES) group of Taiwan's Mechanical Industry Research Laboratories (MIRL) in meeting their needs on enterprise applications integration for producing the data exchange specifications. There are seven stages in this process model, but only the analysis-and-design stage is specific to XML characteristics for defining Data Type Definition (DTD) to be used with XML in the inter-organizational data exchange. This paper illustrates the core sub-process of defining DTD and producing XML documents. We start with a MIRL example regarding information exchange of a work order between the MIRL-MES and an ERP system connected by IBM MQSeries. Then the RosettaNet components are used to demonstrate how additional elements can be incorporated in the analysis-and-design stage by comparisons. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Enterprise Application Integration (EAT) would be linking diverse systems and applications across the enterprise to enable the enterprise IT systems to adapt to the dynamic business environment and automate any business practices. Whereas, with traditional EAI solution, it is difficult to efficiently link the different proprietary applications and data sources, and difficult to enable the system to rapidly identify and respond to changes in the dynamic business environment. In order to solve these problems, this paper uses the Web services technology for EAI. This paper discusses the traditional EAI technologies and the bottlenecks for applications integration, also elaborates the Web services technology and the advantages suited for applications integration. Therefore, the model of EAI with Web services (EAIWS) is proposed to efficiently implement the integration of diverse applications and systems within or between the enterprises. With EAIWS, this paper provides an example to show how the application system works. This paper also discusses the advantages of EAIWS.

AB  - These days, companies need information systems that can quickly adapt to the constantly changing business environment. One of the technologies for meeting this need is Enterprise Application Integration (EAI). EAI can provide an infrastructure for promptly establishing a link between business applications according to a business process. However, to quickly respond to changes, it is first necessary to detect those changes by analyzing and evaluating business activities. Therefore, to realize an information system that can respond to changes more quickly, a new technology called Business Process Management (BPM) has been added to EAI so it can also be used to analyze and evaluate business activities. BPM is now the principal technology of EAI, and it is already being used in enterprise front-ends, which are heavily dependent on human workflows.

AB  - To achieve standard and coherent management at different levels within enterprises, and realize the seamless integration of Business Process Management (BPM) cross enterprises, a new BPM architecture was proposed. After the concept and function of BPM system were presented, the architecture was built on two popular BPM architectures. The architecture focused on the following three aspects: the level of business management, the supply chain management and the product lifecycle management. In this architecture, various business management levels, domains and cross organizations were maintained in a standard manner, and information technology was utilized to fulfill it. Then the key technology to implement the BPM system was discussed, and the BPM technology was compared to the workflow technology, Enterprise application integration (EAI) technology and Enterprise Resource Plan (ERP) technology, concentrating on their differences and relationships. Finally it is concluded that BPM is the development trend of enterprise information system architecture in the next generation.

AB  - Enterprise information systems support and control operational business processes ranging from simple internal back-office processes to complex interorganizational processes. Technologies such as workflow management (WFM), enterprise application integration (EAI), enterprise resource planning (ERP), and web services (WS) typically focus on the realization of IT support rather than monitoring the operational business processes. Process mining aims at extracting information from event logs to capture the business process as it is being executed. In this paper, we put the topic of process mining into context, discuss the main issues around process mining, and finally we introduce the papers in this special issue. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Using the hospital as an example for service sectors with a heterogeneous application landscape, we put forward the hypothesis that it is not feasible to implement cost accounting applications inside operative systems such as ERP, as it is assumed by the conventional data warehousing approach. Rather, the data warehouse, with its extraction, validation and transformation tools, delivers the right platform, creating an application layer which acts on the data before it is being loaded into multidimensional cubes. The cost accounting application enriches the data in the data warehouse by imputing costs and profits to the various calculatory objects such as ledgers, cost centres and cost objects (products). Our hypothesis is further validated by the fact that typical data warehousing tools, e.g. tree structures, are ideal for defining the often complicated calculation metadata.

AB  - Information systems (IS) have become the organisational fabric for intra- and inter-organisational collaboration in business. As a result, there is mounting pressure from customers and suppliers for a direct move away from disparate systems operating in parallel towards a more common shared architecture. In part, this has been achieved through the emergence of new technology that is being packaged into a portfolio of technologies known as enterprise application integration (EAI). Its emergence however, is presenting investment decision-makers charged with the evaluation of IS with an interesting challenge. The integration of IS in-line with the needs of the business is extending their identify and lifecycle, making it difficult to evaluate the full impact of the system as it has no definitive start and/or end. Indeed, the argument presented in this paper is that traditional life cycle models are changing as a result of technologies that support their integration with other systems. In this paper, the need for a better understanding of EAI and its impact on IS lifecycles are discussed and a classification framework proposed. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Enterprise-application integration (EAI), the nimble strategy that involves technology and process that enables disparate systems to exchange business-level information in languages that each understands, provides the backbone infrastructure for implementing a business-process model. Ultimately, EAI serves as the enabler of high-level strategies detailed out as part of a business-process modeling effort and provides the flexible framework to address changing business climates.

AB  - Integrating disparate systems with different roles in different places is being touted as the way to get more from existing IT investment. Newer packaged enterprise application integration (EAI) platforms promise less expensive, more scaleable and flexible integration, however, there is still no all-encompassing solution. To justify use of EAI, one must take a close look on cost reduction, time reduction and a drive towards improved transparency with real ROI.

AB  - The realization of specific coupling strategies and integration techniques is discussed exemplarily for a university hospital, the Universitätsklinikum Leipzig (UKL) in Germany. The integration of the central patient management system serving the administrative department with the clinical workplace systems serving hospital wards is presented. We analyse the integration with respect to the underlying theoretical conceptions and discuss information management issues for deployment and maintenance of the overall IT infrastructure. This paper presents the pros and cons of synchronous and asynchronous patient data replication, the practical experience with the deployment of a communication server, and the experience with using an RFC interface, a proprietary interface to the enterprise resource planning system SAP R/3. Both, organizational and technical issues are addressed in this context.

AB  - Enterprise information systems, such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), have often been criticized for their rigidity. Alternatively, global, matrixed enterprises often follow a federated information systems approach. The first type of enterprises, which we call the standardized enterprises, lack flexibility, while the second type, which we call decentralized enterprises, lack visibility. To create what we shall call an adaptive enterprise the information systems strategy should achieve both these goals: visibility and flexibility. I discuss the problems associated with the lack of either of these two, and how information integration technology, within the enterprise application integration space, can lead to the creation of adaptive enterprises. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Although there is much to be gained from linking disparate applications, and with web-based loose integration getting cheaper and easier, manufacturers have a long way to go. Enterprise application integration (EAI), particularly, is one of the burning issues facing companies as they strive to get the most out of their IT investments. As such, information visibility is determined to be the key to manufacturing as systems generate a glut of data that is often not in the right place or format to support business decision making.

Application servers that support the delivery of application logic as Web services are another factor. Combining such pieces is the best prescription for integration pain.

AB  - The rapid upsurge of e-business has forced companies to see beyond their corporate perimeters to integrate their business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) applications with existing solutions like supply chain management (SCM), enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer relationship management (CRM). As integration solutions become business imperative, e-business is powering unprecedented growth in enterprise application integration (EAI).

AB  - Integration between business systems and the plant floor has been the poor relation to enterprise application integration. On one hand, there is a new and accelerating driver - the Internet. On the other, standards are fast emerging that make sensor to boardroom integration easier and less expensive. Everything is set for change, and manufacturing must plan to change with it. Manufacturers must look beyond their four walls to get onto `e'. One must understand the limitations of existing systems. ERP systems are not only designed for providing high-level visibility of real time data, driven from the factory floor.

AB  - System development should be considered as a professional engineering discipline. Failure is a fundamental difficulty which relates to the development process itself where large projects tend to be long term, highly structured, strongly based on the originating concept and not well disposed to new input or software patches. The solutions for tackling the difficulties are presented.

AB  - Today, manufacturers are increasingly turning to enterprise application integration (EAI) frameworks to tie enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems to internal and external applications used to manage enterprise and supply chain operations. EAI packages are applications and the underlying messaging and data transformation tools that link applications together.

AB  - Enterprise resource planning (ERP) was supposed to be the answer for manufacturing firms aiming to use information technology (IT) to control processes throughout the business. However, ERP never really began to deal with the design side of the manufacturing business, nor did it address the control and monitoring of manufacturing equipment on the shop floor. Now enterprise application integration (EAI) promises to really achieve what ERP failed to do. By allowing applications to talk to each other, the `glue' that EAI represents really should achieve the holy grail of a completely integrated set of IT applications within a business. But this will only happen if EAI technologies take the process approach.

AB  - With electronic-commerce driving customer expectations of faster and faster delivery of both information and manufactured products, tighter integration between shop floor and enterprise systems can yield substantially improved customer responsiveness. Integrating systems between and within plants, and out into the supply chain is already repaying good dividends, certainly in the process sector.

AB  - Supply chain optimization solutions remain a prominent part of the supply chain management software space, but it has now clearly evolved into the two major areas of execution and planning. The supply chain execution suites of today encompass multisite order management, warehouse management system (WMS) functions, and logistics and transportation planning and management. Besides optimization and execution, customer relationship management (CRM) applications are also considered as the third major subcategory of the supply chain management software space.

AB  - To meet user needs, enterprise resources planning (ERP), warehouse management system (WMS), and transportation management system (TMS) suppliers offer a wide range of methodologies, integration packages, and implementation tools. All of these developments focus on the goal of more standardization and less programming. Manufacturers such as Alfa Aesar and Trane Co. are integrating supply chain and ERP systems to reduce customization and maintenance, increase real-time data accuracy, and improve order processing.
