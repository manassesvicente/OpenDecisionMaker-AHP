AB Equity is frequently cited as one of the key design aspects of
   environmental governance regimes. In the context of Reduced Emissions
   from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+), a forest-based
   climate change mitigation instrument, the manner in which equity' is
   understood will be of critical importance for the impacts and acceptance
   of REDD+policies and initiatives. Whereas the concept has been
   extensively studied in the academic literature, references to equity in
   REDD+policy debates and documents are often vague, leaving room for
   various interpretations and modes of implementation. In our case study
   of the Tanzanian national REDD+policy domain, we provide a conceptual
   framework based on an institutional logics approach for analysing the
   various underlying rationalities in the equity in REDD+' debate. We
   apply it to demonstrate how the involved policy actors draw from
   heterogeneous equity logics in their support for and opposition to
   different governance models, highlighting the importance of precise
   contextualization and operationalization of broad international
   principles in national REDD+initiatives. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley &

AB Small-scale, decentralized and community-owned renewable energy is
   widely acknowledged to be a desirable feature of low carbon futures, but
   faces a range of challenges in the context of conventional, centralized
   energy systems. This paper draws on transition frameworks to investigate
   why the UK has been an inhospitable context for community-owned
   renewables and assesses whether anything fundamental is changing in this
   regard. We give particular attention to whether political devolution,
   the creation of elected governments for Scotland, Wales and Northern
   Ireland, has affected the trajectory of community renewables. Our
   analysis notes that devolution has increased political attention to
   community renewables, including new policy targets and support schemes.
   However, these initiatives are arguably less important than the
   persistence of key features of socio-technical regimes: market support
   systems for renewable energy and land-use planning arrangements that
   systemically favour major projects and large corporations, and keep
   community renewables to the margins. There is scope for rolling out
   hybrid pathways to community renewables, via joint ownership or through
   community benefit funds, but this still positions community energy as an
   adjunct to energy pathways dominated by large, corporate generation
   facilities. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP

AB This paper studies the experience of foreign-funded programmes aimed at
   establishing participatory forest management (PFM), primarily in the
   walnut-fruit forests of Kyrgyzstan. Having reviewed programme reports,
   non-governmental organization evidence and legislation, we argue that
   the poor performance of these programmes is due largely to incorrect
   starting assumptions about the feasibility of PFM in the Kyrgyz context
   and a lack of analysis about locally appropriate forestry regimes. We
   show that there have been no significant preconditions for realization
   of PFM mechanisms in the history of Kyrgyz forestry, and their
   realization has been hampered by the Soviet legacy, strong informal
   institutions and poverty. We argue that PFM has been introduced without
   a clear understanding of how it fits in the overall vision of the
   country's development. Moreover, PFM is not fit for purpose in
   Kyrgyzstan, as it does not address the root macro-economic and
   environmental causes of existing forestry problems. The capacity of
   local communities should not be over-emphasized where cross-sectoral
   national or even cross-border efforts are required. Mutual, joint
   learning of Western donors with local experts is key, and should not be
   replaced by automatic adoption of imported concepts. Copyright (c) 2014

AB Extreme events such as floods present major challenges for water
   governance in many parts of the world. Following two rounds of
   disastrous floods in 2010 and 2011, the need for a change in Pakistan's
   approach to dealing with floods has been highlighted in the literature.
   However, scant attention has been given to the nature of an alternative
   framework and the mechanism for driving a change towards it. This
   research aims to provide a better understanding of how Pakistan can cope
   with future flood challenges by examining the role of learning processes
   in facilitating a change towards an adaptive governance framework that
   is considered useful for dealing with complex issues in an uncertain
   environment. Key informant interviews and document analysis are used to
   examine characteristics of the current regime, analyse the influence of
   learning processes on flood governance dynamics, and identify barriers
   and bridges to change. Study findings show that state actors continue to
   dominate flood governance. However, the actor network in emergency flood
   management has broadened, with increasing participation by non-state
   actors. Single-loop learning, limited to routine improvements, is
   predominant among state actors in preventive management. A few state and
   non-state actors in emergency management exhibit double-loop learning
   reflected by their reframing of problems and incorporation of new
   information. However, in the absence of any triple-loop learning
   associated with a paradigm change, the overall impact of learning
   processes in facilitating a transition towards more adaptive approaches
   to flood governance has been limited. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley &

AB Resource extraction often precludes sustainable forms of land use and
   poses long-term threats, and yet it is promoted as a development
   opportunity for poor countries. This is illustrated by a case study of
   the Kumtor gold mine in Kyrgyzstan. Compared with a large gold mine,
   most alternative activities, such as tourism, trophy hunting, cottage
   industry and pastoralism, can only generate negligible benefits. Other,
   potentially much more important, sources of income for poor countries
   are payments for ecosystem services taking the form of compensation
   preventing unsustainable forms of land use. The discussion focuses on
   how these could be organized to provide viable alternatives to mining.
   It is concluded that such systems need to be arranged at the
   international level and to complement the current international
   cooperation (aid) regime. In Central Asia, reviving the regional water
   management system would be an important first step in this direction.

   on historical and political institutional arrangements to approach the
   current framework of climate change agenda-setting in Mexico, later
   analysing the potential changes to the outcomes due to the influence of
   an international climate change regime. On the one hand, the literature
   suggests that federalism poses serious limitations to government
   efficacy due to division of competences, and a similar argument is posed
   about presidentialism under a politically fragmented regime; on the
   second hand, transnationalism is depicted to enhance subnational state
   and non-state actor leadership roles in many areas, including economic
   and environmental policy setting. Evidence shows that federalism and the
   political fragmentation of the presidential regime in Mexico has
   prevented the federal government from taking assertive steps to
   influence subnational governments, while some of the heads of
   politically relevant subnational governments have assumed policy
   leadership roles, enabled by transnational networks and the Kyoto
   climate change regime. This balance may change according to the nature
   of the post-Kyoto regime, either strengthening the federal government if
   more responsibility on actions and disbursement is placed on national
   governments; or enabling subnational government to foster their
   position, if decentralized and transnational networks are strengthened.

   democratic rights) factors, may influence environmental policy-making,

   environmental sustainability) of the countries in the current study is

   Index (2008) and Corruption Perceptions Index (2008) are considered as

AB The Baltic Sea region has in recent years become known as a pioneer of
   new modes of governance, reflecting the dynamic development of the
   network society. At the same time, the Baltic Sea is considered one of
   the world's most polluted seas, especially in terms of eutrophication,
   the accelerated enrichment of nutrients in the water. Overall, there is
   a contrast between the formally successful governance system and the
   actual state of the Baltic Sea. This paper describes the existing Baltic
   Sea environmental governance system, from the regional regime to
   non-governmental actors, noting that highly institutionalized
   inter-state and transnational environmental cooperation adds a greater
   element of hierarchy for environmental governance in the region.
   Supporting democratic development is a special requirement for
   governance in the post-Cold War context. The paper explicates governance
   challenges posed by the emerging network society, on the one hand, and
   the problem of eutrophication, on the other, and makes suggestions on
   how to develop the governance system in order to meet the challenges. As
   a conclusion, a general lesson for the management of international water
   bodies is given. Institutional diversity with many different scale
   preoccupations is key, but so is the need for leaders to overcome the
   challenges of polycentric governance: that is, to reduce opacity of
   governing and to increase the power of stakeholders to define the
   problem and its solutions in the first place. Copyright (c) 2013 John

AB This article examines the relationship between technology and policy
   change, focusing on shifts in Israel's water regime as a case example.
   Technologies, especially systems of large-scale infrastructures, have
   offered an explanation for the stability and stagnation of policy
   regimes in what has been termed lock-in and path dependency. Our paper
   focuses on the reverse phenomenon: on how technology or change in it can
   induce policy change. Israeli decision-makers have recently embraced
   desalination technology as a substitute for natural resources, because
   earlier policies, characterized by a strategy of environmental
   brinkmanship, have resulted in degradation of natural sources and risk
   future supply. This analysis is based on extensive document analysis and
   in-depth interviews. We suggest that technological breakthroughs that
   rendered desalination economically feasible also undermined long-lasting
   hydro-ideological support for agriculture, introduced new ideas about
   water abundance and engendered policy change. Desalination contributed
   to these shifts because it allowed the displacement of environmental
   externalities, economic costs and hard political choices to other policy
   sectors and levels of governance as well as reallocating them between
   political actors, bureaucrats and professionals. It is important to make
   displacements like these more visible in order to emphasize more
   comprehensive and longer-term problem solving rather than problem
   avoidance or postponement. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and

   trial to study the cognitive functioning in Han Chinese first-episode
   schizophrenic patients in a 12-week treatment regime with olanzapine
   (129 cases) or placebo (132 cases). The results showed that (1) the
   patientswith first-episode schizophrenia showed significant deficits in
   the long-term memory, short-term memory, immediate memory and memory
   quotient by WMS-IV assessment, and decreases the total scores, positive
   symptoms, negative symptoms and general psychopathology by PANSS
   assessment; (2) olanzapine could significantly improve the PANSS scores
   including total scores, positive symptoms, negative symptoms and general
   psychopathology in the first-episode schizophrenic patients; (3)
   olanzapine could significantly improve the short-term memory, immediate
   memory and memory quotient in the first-episode schizophrenic patients;
   and (3) although the latencies of P-2, N-2 and P-3 were significantly
   prolonged, P-2 and P-3 amplitudes were decreased and the latencies of
   N-1 did not change, olanzapine did not influence any P-300 items in the
   first-episode schizophrenic patients. The data suggested that that
   olanzapine could improve cognitive process, such as memorizing and
   extraction of the information although there were many changes of
   cognitive functions in Han Chinese first-episode schizophrenic patients.

AB Over the last decades, new governance mechanisms such as partnerships
   have been increasingly accepted as instruments for sustainable
   development. This article contributes to an improved understanding of
   the contributions of partnerships, and their interactions with and
   consequences for intergovernmental regimes. It answers the question to
   what extent the roles of international intersectoral partnerships in
   biodiversity governance can be assessed using a positive, negative, or
   utilitarian qualification. To answer this question, the article develops
   and applies a methodology to analyze the governance functions that
   partnerships fulfill, and the institutional interaction (in terms of
   content, discourses, and rules) between the partnerships and
   intergovernmental regimes. Two case studies are analyzed: the Great Apes
   Survival Project (GRASP), and the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund
   (CEPF), which works on biodiversity hotspots. Contrary to most
   partnerships, these conservation partnerships do not use the market as a
   steering mechanism for sustainable development, but focus on enhancing
   international policy processes. The article concludes that the
   partnerships reinvent biodiversity policy and politics, which is
   necessary to improve the effectiveness of the biodiversity governance
   system, and that they complement intergovernmental regimes, albeit with
   varying effectiveness. Recommendations are developed for governments to
   strategically enhance publicprivate interaction. Copyright (C) 2010 John

AB Subnational governments (such as provinces, states or regions) are
   largely ignored in international policy documents on sustainable
   development, and they are not recognized in multilateral
   decision-making. Nevertheless, many subnational governments have
   launched sustainable development policies. This article examines to what
   extent they take global sustainable development governance into account
   when doing so. The theoretical framework presents two mechanisms of
   international influence, building mostly upon the policy convergence
   literature. That framework is then applied on a comparative policy
   analysis of five subnational governments: North Holland (the
   Netherlands), North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany), Wallonia (Belgium),
   Flanders (Belgium) and Quebec (Canada). The findings show that
   subnational governments with a distinct territorial identity react
   differently on international trends from other subnational governments.
   Flanders and Quebec, which have such an identity, follow the rules and
   decision-making procedures of the international sustainable development
   regime, and they translate the norms and principles into their policies.
   The article also finds that the influence of international policies is
   determined by the active participation of subnational governments in
   multilateral decision-making. Finally, it is argued that the legitimacy
   pressures exerted by international organizations on lower-level
   governments to adopt certain policies have a varying impact on
   subnational governments dependent on their domestic context. Copyright

   existing policies, property rights, informal institutions and governance
   structures. We conducted comparative case studies based on a framework
   of institutional analysis, using literature survey, document analysis
   and in-depth stakeholder interviews. Results show that among the
   determining factors for policy effectiveness are property rights regimes
   and land-use rights, traditions in the provision of advisory services,
   farmers' previous experience with soil conservation practices and
   policies, perceived threat of enforcement, and trust in administrative

   treatment followed by four weeks of in vivo ERP or eight weeks of in
   vivo ERP alone. Treatment was conducted on an intensive basis, with
   individual sessions held three times a week for 90 minutes for a total
   of 24 sessions in eight weeks. At midpoint, four weeks of cognitive or
   behavioral therapy (12 sessions) resulted in significant improvements on
   measures of overall BDD symptoms, anxiety, and depression, but not on
   satisfaction with various body parts, maladaptive appearance beliefs,
   and social distress. At posttreatment, results indicated that ERP was
   equally effective as a combination of cognitive and behavior therapy At
   eight weeks significant improvement was noted on all measures except
   satisfaction with various body parts and quality of life. It appears
   that eight weeks of treatment is better than four, and that cognitive
   therapy does not enhance treatment outcome. Recommendations for future
   research evaluating variables which influence treatment outcome arc
   discussed.

AB Research indicates that impairment of working memory may be one of the
   factors that impede the ability to read fluently and accurately.
   Although the capacity of working memory is traditionally considered to
   be constant, recent data point to a certain plasticity in the neural
   system that underlies working memory, which can be improved by training.
   We examined whether dyslexic readers' recall span and speed of
   processing in working memory can be increased, enhancing the quality of
   their reading. Thirty five skilled readers and twenty six dyslexic
   readers were trained in working memory tasks and compared to control
   groups of fifteen skilled and fifteen dyslexic readers who complete a
   self-paced reading training regime. All subjects were trained over a
   six-week period. Reading and working memory indicators were collected
   before and after the two trainings. Brain activity using measures of
   event-related potential (ERP) were collected for the working memory
   training groups by using a working memory task (Sternberg task). Result
   indicated after working memory training the ability to store verbal and
   visual-spatial information in working memory increased, and decoding,
   reading rate and comprehension scores improved in both groups, although
   the gap between the dyslexic and the control groups in reading and
   working memory scores remained constant. The latency of the P300
   component decreased and the amplitude increased in all participants
   following training. No training effect in any parameter was obtained in
   the self-paced reading training groups. These findings support the
   notion of plasticity in the neural system underlying working memory and
   point to the relationships between larger working memory capacity and
   enhancement of reading skills. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   to understanding the phenomenon of policy learning and its structural
   constraints in the field of river basin management, in particular
   related to coping with current and future climatic hazards such as
   floods and droughts. This has been done by a formal comparative analysis
   of eight water management regimes, by using multi-value qualitative
   comparative analysis, focusing on the relationship between regime
   characteristics (as explanatory variables) and different levels of
   policy learning (as output value). This research has revealed the
   importance of the socio-cognitive dimension, as an essential emerging
   property of complex adaptive governance systems. This socio-cognitive
   dimension depends on a specific set of structural conditions; in
   particular, better integrated cooperation structures in combination with
   advanced information management are the key factors leading towards
   higher levels of policy learning. Furthermore, this research highlights
   a number of significant positive correlations between different regime
   elements, thereby identifying a stabilizing mechanism in current
   management regimes, and this research also highlights the necessity of
   fine-tuning centralized control with bottom-up approaches. Copyright (C)

AB As the implications of a changing climate come into focus, attention
   must shift to effectively stimulating action in response to this
   dramatically pervasive phenomenon. Responses to climate change, however,
   are embedded in institutional procedures, technological pathways and
   cultural practices that are characterized by deep inertia. By paying
   express attention to linkages among disciplines, this paper takes steps
   towards contributing a richer definition of the development path
   concept, identifying realms of inquiry that may together be called a
   'development path' literature and discussing ways in which this sheds
   light on effective responses to global climate change. This paper
   reveals the value of fundamentally interdisciplinary approaches to
   climate change responses, the necessity of a deeper understanding of the
   context of action on climate change and the ubiquity of path dependence.
   Rooted in the underlying socio-technical, institutional and
   socio-cultural development paths, barriers to action may best be
   addressed through contextually specific, inter-disciplinary analyses of

AB This paper employs smooth transition autoregressive (STAR) models to
   investigate the nonlinear dynamic behavior of exchange rate deviations
   based on the exchange rate parity (ERP) theory in four Asian economies:
   Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore. In this study, quarterly data
   from 1978 Q1 through 2007 Q4 are analyzed. The empirical results
   indicate that the deviations in the exchange rate of all four countries
   reject the null of linearity. The rate deviations in the Japanese and
   Korean cases exhibit a dynamic and smoothly symmetric ESTAR type
   process, while those in the Taiwanese and Singaporean cases match the
   smoothly asymmetric LSTAR type with respect to depreciating and
   appreciating regimes. These nonlinear characteristics can be explained
   by the existence of heterogeneous behavior and asymmetric information
   among economic agents. Furthermore, the estimation results of a
   nonlinear least squares (NLS) regression indicate that most of the
   parameter estimates are significant at the 10 percent level. The
   forecasted Japanese and Korean rate deviations in the ESTAR model are
   not superior to those from the AR model, possibly because these two
   countries experienced a serious fluctuation during the Asian financial
   crisis that occurred in 1997. However, based on the criterion of the
   RMSE, the forecasted Taiwanese and Singaporean rate deviations in the
   LSTAR model outperform those in the AR model. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

AB We introduce an approach to compensate for temporal distortions of
   repeated measurements in event-related potential research. The algorithm
   uses a combination of methods from nonlinear time-series analysis and is
   based on the construction of pairwise registration functions from
   cross-recurrence plots of the phase-space representations of ERP
   signals. The globally optimal multiple-alignment path is approximated by
   hierarchical cluster analysis, i.e. by iteratively combining pairs of
   trials according to similarity. By the inclusion of context information
   in form of externally acquired time markers (e.g. reaction time) into a
   regularization scheme, the extracted warping functions can be guided
   near paths that are implied by the experimental procedure. All
   parameters occurring in the algorithm can be optimized based on the
   properties of the data and there is a broad regime of parameter
   configurations where the algorithm produces good results. Simulations on
   artificial data and the analysis of ERPs from a psychophysical study
   demonstrate the robustness and applicability of the algorithm.

AB As currently designed and implemented, the Clean Development Mechanism
   (CDM) under the Kyoto Protocol is a market mechanism that creates
   'offset' credits, named CERs (certified emission reductions). These
   credits are issued to Annex I Parties that invest in projects both
   reducing emissions and contributing to sustainable development in
   developing countries. This paper explores how CER weights could be used
   to reform and improve this mechanism. On the one hand, weights strictly
   lower than 1, or discount factors, would improve the environmental
   effectiveness of the CDM, enhancing global greenhouse gas emission
   mitigation while addressing the additionality concern. On the other
   hand, weights higher than 1, or multiplication factors, could increase
   the competitiveness of project types and/or host countries currently
   underrepresented in the CDM pipeline. This paper concentrates on
   stimulating investment from developed nations to less developed
   countries and aims at reducing the disparity between the three main CDM
   host countries (Brazil, India and China) and less developed nations.
   Based on statistical data published by the United Nations Framework
   Convention on Climate Change, our analysis then considers different
   policies, estimates their impacts, and shows how a sensible mix of
   discounting and multiplication could lead to a more equitable
   geographical distribution of CDM projects and possibly create

AB Over the last two million years, humans have colonized almost the entire
   biosphere on Earth, thereby creating socio-ecological systems in which
   fundamental patterns and processes are co-regulated by socio-economic
   and ecological processes. We postulate that the evolution of coupled
   socio-ecological systems can be characterized by a sequence of
   relatively stable configurations, here denoted as 'socio-metabolic
   regimes', and comparatively rapid transitions between such regimes. We
   discern three fundamentally different socio-metabolic regimes:
   hunter-gatherers, agrarian societies and industrial society. Transitions
   between these regimes fundamentally change socio-ecological
   interactions, whereas changes and variations within each regime are
   gradual. Two-thirds of the world population are currently within a rapid
   transition from the agrarian to the industrial regime. Many current
   global sustainability problems are a direct consequence of this
   transition. The central hypothesis discussed in this article is that
   industrial society is at least as different from a future sustainable
   society as it is from the agrarian regime. The challenge of
   sustainability is, therefore, a fundamental re-orientation of society
   and the economy, not the implementation of some technical fixes. Based
   on empirical data for global resource use (material and energy flows,
   land use), this essay questions the notion that the promotion of
   eco-efficiency is sufficient for achieving sustainability, and outlines
   the reasons why a transition to a new socio-metabolic regime is now
   required. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

   addition, it depicts the cyclical patterns of political activity dealing
   with sustainability and identifies the main sustainability goals and
   targets endorsed by several political initiatives. These tasks are
   accomplished through a literature review and an assessment of indicators
   dealing with political will. It is concluded that global sustainability
   governance followed an intermittent path characterized by two periods of
   significant accomplishments (until 1979; 1987-1995) and by two others
   less successful (1980-1986; 1995 onwards, interrupted by a peak around
   2000). Peaks in political activity coincide with the decennial Earth
   Summits, suggesting their major influence as catalysts of more profound
   societal and political action. Sustainability concerns and goals shifted
   from an emphasis on pollution control and availability of natural
   resources to a more balanced position that puts human development at the

AB This paper explores the factors associated with voluntary decisions to
   assure social, environmental and sustainability reports. Since the
   market for assurance services in this area is in its formative stages,
   there is a limited understanding of the demand for this emergent
   non-financial auditing practice, which is evolving rapidly across
   different countries. Drawing from extant literature in international
   auditing and environmental accounting, we focus on a set of
   country-level institutional factors to explain the adoption of
   sustainability assurance statements among an international panel of 212
   Fortune Global 250 companies for the years 1999, 2002 and 2005.
   Consistent with our expectations, our results provide evidence that
   companies operating in countries that are more stakeholder oriented and
   have a weaker governance enforcement regime are more likely to adopt a
   sustainability assurance statement. Further, the demand for assurance is
   higher in countries where sustainable corporate practices are better
   enabled by market and institutional mechanisms. Our exploratory findings
   also indicate that the likelihood of choosing a large accounting firm as
   assurance provider increases for companies domiciled in countries that
   are shareholder oriented and have a lower level of litigation. We
   conclude the paper by suggesting three directions of research in the
   area of sustainability assurance that have relevant academic and
   practical implications. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and

   Compliance with regulations in the market is one aspect of the

   the value-added tax (VAT) issues during large ERP projects, there is a
   higher VAT-risk exposure. In a design-oriented approach, we first
   identify the stakeholders and their interests in the VAT compliance of
   ERP systems. Enterprise architecture (EA) and model driven engineering
   in a multi-level perspective serve as the source of solution patterns.

AB We address the seemingly implausible project of moving the technical
   support of complex organisational technologies online. We say
   'implausible' because from the point of view of micro-sociological
   analysis and the influential work of Orr (1996) there is a consensus
   that the diagnosis and resolution of technical failures is an
   intrinsically 'localised affair' (i.e., rooted within a specific place
   and time). Notwithstanding this view, technology producers have been
   pushing in the recent period to develop online forms of support. Today,
   and particularly in the area of organisational software, many technical
   failures are now repaired at a distance. How is this possible given the
   consensus amongst sociologists? Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork
   conducted at a major software producer we show how repair work has been
   recast and inserted in a new geographical and temporal regime. This has
   implications for how sociologists of technology conceptualise the nature
   and practice of technical failure but also the time and situation in
   which it occurs. We attempt to refocus understandings of technical
   problems from a preoccupation with their rootedness onto how they are
   lifted out of local contexts and passed around globally distributed
   offices in search of requisite specialist expertise. Importantly, whilst
   virtualisation appears a seemingly effective means to resolve failures
   it also has negative consequences. Whereas in more traditional types of
   technical support place-based social relations are seen to bear the
   burden of controlling and regulating support, in online forms other
   means have to be found. Our conceptual aim is to move away from a view
   of repair revolving exclusively around the situation conceived of as a
   'small place'. Rather, since support work is increasingly 'stretched
   out' across a global network of labs connected up by technologies, it
   now takes place across an extended situation. We work up this notion
   first to highlight how aspects once seen as central to localist forms of
   analysis are no longer the only organising features as technical work
   moves online and second to demonstrate the various ways in which the
   locales for this work are now mediated by technology. (C) 2009 Elsevier

   The paper presents three case studies of company interpretation of and
   response to changes in this regulatory field, focusing particularly on
   the third review by the economic regulator, in 1999, which involved a
   reduction of the prices companies were allowed to charge their
   customers. This had significant but complex repercussions for
   environmental strategy and management in the companies, with different
   impacts on mandatory and non-mandatory activities. It also showed in
   relief the opportunities for building coalitions between companies and
   the environmental regulator, both in general terms and revolving around

   are associated with process innovations, but that this is moderated by
   the interaction of environmental management system implementation with

   development, a well developed theory encompassing all aspects of
   corporate environmental behaviour, especially incorporating incentive
   compatible public policy measures, is yet to be developed. This paper is
   a step in this direction, aiming to assimilate contributions related to
   different aspects of corporate environmental behaviour, capturing the
   transition from environmental management to environmental strategy. In
   the process we identify areas where there is a need for further
   research. We find that there is plenty of scope in developing more
   complex models to explain a manager's rationale for adopting sustainable
   strategies in the backdrop of the policy regime, and in conducting more
   empirical (both descriptive and quantitative) work to obtain clearer
   insights into managerial decisions. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley &

AB Participation in the New Zealand fishing industry exists on two levels:
   quota holding and quota ownership. This study is motivated by the desire
   to establish whether changes in the number and concentration of quota
   ownerships and quota holdings have had any impact on the sustainability
   of fishery in New Zealand.
   Of the 294 marine species commercially harvested in New Zealand the top
   15 by volume and/or value are considered in this paper. Findings
   indicate that quota ownership and holding have become more concentrated
   since the inception of the individual transferable quota (ITQ) regime,
   with the concentration ratios CR4, CR10 and CR20 all increasing. This
   suggests that the introduction of the ITQ has not encouraged the entry
   of new market participants; rather the industry has moved toward a
   single ownership model.
   Second, this paper establishes trends in the level of total allocable
   commercial catch (TACC) over the study period (August 1986-june 2000).
   Findings suggest that, with one or two interesting exceptions, catch
   levels have remained remarkably constant. Prima facie, there appears to
   have been no adverse impact from structural change on the overall
   resource sustainability based on TACC. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley &

AB An original approach to the solution of the nonlinear Schrodinger
   equation (NLSE) is pursued in this paper, following the regular
   perturbation (RP) method. Such an iterative method provides a
   closed-form approximation of the received field and is thus appealing
   for devising nonlinear equalization/compensation techniques for optical
   transmission systems operating in the nonlinear regime. It is shown
   that, when the nonlinearity is due to the Kerr effect alone, the order n
   RP solution coincides with the order 2n + 1 Volterra series solution
   proposed by Brandt-Pearce and co-workers. The RP method thus provides a
   computationally efficient way of evaluating the Volterra kernels, with a
   complexity comparable to that of the split-step Fourier method (SSFM).
   Numerical results on 10 Gb/s single-channel terrestrial transmission
   systems employing common dispersion maps show that the simplest
   third-order Volterra series solution is applicable only in the weakly
   nonlinear propagation regime, for peak transmitted power well below 5
   dBm. However, the insight in the nonlinear propagation phenomenon
   provided by the RP method suggests an enhanced regular perturbation
   (ERP) method, which allows the first-order ERP solution to be fairly
   accurate for terrestrial dispersion-mapped systems up to launched peak
   powers of 10 dBm.

AB In this paper, it is argued that the view of the economic sphere as a
   closed system can-not appropriately deal with the issue of sustainable
   development. Evolutionary economics is then presented as a fruitful
   alternative to apprehend the interactions between the economic, the
   human and the natural spheres. This emerging field offers both a firm
   theoretical basis (based upon recent developments in physics, biology,
   dynamic systems theory and the sciences of complexity) and practical,
   pragmatic answers to the implementation of a sustainable path of
   development. This is further illustrated with the presentation of the
   evolutionary logic of a multi-level common regime. Such a regime could
   be an institutional counterpart of social and environmental dynamics.

AB From the moment the Berlin Wall came down scholars and politicians
   around the world expressed concern about an upsurge of extreme-right
   politics in Eastern Europe. Dramatic events like the Yugoslav conflict
   and even the so-called 'velvet split' of Czechoslovakia only
   strengthened this fear. Despite these many general warnings about the
   rise of extreme right parties (ERPs) in Eastern Europe very little
   empirical work has appeared on the subject. Mudde's article provides an
   analytical tool which will help to further understanding of the extreme
   right in the region. It presents and applies a fairly straightforward
   typology of ERPs in Eastern Europe based on the (ideological) character
   of the parties. The pre-Communist ERP locates the origin of its
   ideological identity in political parties and ideas of the pre-Communist
   period, generally harking back to national-conservative, monarchist, or
   indigenous or foreign fascist ideals. The character of the party might
   be expressed in the open espousal of pre-Communist ideas or by using the
   associated 'folklore', while in some cases there might even be
   continuity in personnel or organizations (often through the emigre
   community). With the notable exceptions of Croatia and Slovakia,
   pre-Communist ERPs have remained marginal in post-Communist political
   life. The Communist ERP looks for ideological inspiration in the
   Communist period and includes nationalist splits of the (former)
   Communist parties as well as new parties that combine a nationalist
   ideology with a nostalgia for Communist rule. They are mainly successful
   in countries where the Communist regime had a strong nationalist
   undercurrent and the party is still in the hands of hardliners (e.g.
   Romania and Russia). Post-Communist ERPs, finally, locate the source of
   their identities in the post-Communist period: these organizations are
   new and their focus is on current political issues. They harbour no
   feelings of nostalgia, either for the pre-Communist or the Communist
   period. Post-Communist ERPs have developed in most East European
   countries but, although some have achieved remarkable electoral
   successes, in general they have been only moderately successful (similar
   to ERPs in Western Europe).

AB Appearance of the harmonics in the spectrum of artificial emissions
   generated during heating experiments has been reported earlier. Usually,
   it relates with square modulation of HF powerful wave and distortion of
   this time dependence due to characteristic time of electron
   heating/cooling. In the EISCAT-Heating experiment in November 1993, a
   quasi-sinusoidal modulation regime was used. Observations show the clear
   harmonic structure in artificial emissions in this case too. In the
   present paper we discuss a generation of harmonics of a modulation
   frequency due to nonlinear dependence of value of the ionosphere
   conductivity disturbance from effective radiated power (ERP). A
   numerical model is used for calculations of the spectrum of the integral
   conductivity disturbance variation as a function of electron density
   profile and ERP. For the modulation frequency in the range of 1 - 100
   Hz, the characteristic time of electron heating/cooling was neglected,
   and intensity ratios of the second and third harmonics to the
   fundamental frequency reach 0.4 and 0.15, respectively. For the
   modulation frequency 1375 Hz, time integration of the electron energy
   balance equation was used. The different characteristic time constants
   of the electron heating/cooling at different altitudes make the behavior
   of the intensity ratio and phase shift of the harmonics of the integral
   conductivity disturbance variations more complicated. The values of the
   harmonic amplitude ratio in this case decrease to 0.25 and 0.1.

AB In recent experiments with a pseudo-random sequence of 7 consonants to
   recall after trial (stimulus onset asynchrony 1000 ms) a reverse
   relationship between P300 amplitude of the event-related potential (ERP)
   and letter presentation position was shown (Grune et al., 1996). It was
   assumed that this relationship reflects competition between encoding and
   retention processes in this time regime. In order to find evidence for
   the resource competition hypothesis in working memory a 4x4 grid
   containing 4 digits preceded a sequence of 6 consonants. In the first
   block subjects were instructed to ignore the grid, in two remaining
   blocks they were asked to remember the digits or their position in the
   grid and to recognize them after the letter recall. In the ignore
   condition the expected effect of P300 decrease with letter position was
   found, especially at posterior electrode sites. When subjects had to
   process the preceding digit grid there was no position effect of P300
   caused by small P300 amplitudes in the ERPs that were elicited by the
   first letters of the sequence. This effect was not specific to the
   modality of the interfering with the letter task information from the
   digit grid. We conclude that the grid information occupies working
   memory resources that are not available for the event-related processing
   of consonants to recall.

AB Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded to a digit-probe
   identification and matching task (modified 'Stemberg paradigm') in 29
   patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and 26 healthy subjects. Our
   main aim was to identify the neurophysiological correlates of abnormal
   short term memory function in patients with TLE. Neuropsychological
   tests allowed the definition and comparison of two patient groups
   according to the presence or absence of memory dysfunction. These two
   groups did not differ significantly in mean age, education years, IQ,
   seizure duration, seizure frequency, anti-epileptic drug (AED) regimes,
   or on findings on neuroimaging. ERPs recorded under different levels of
   memory load were analysed both by conventional component identification
   and by an objective computer method of determining mean amplitudes of
   multiple 50 ms epochs (MMA analysis). We found that some significant
   abnormalities were common to both groups of patients; these included
   slow reaction times, a reduced amplitude of the N170 wave (and the
   corresponding 157-210 ms epoch in the MMA analysis) and a broad late
   negative shift between 577 and 735 ms. Other findings, including a
   significantly reduced performance accuracy as the level of memory load
   increased, win restricted to patients with abnormal memory function. The
   ERP changes that were specific to these patients occurred within a
   latency band of 700-420 ms and included a relatively preserved, but
   delayed P250 component and a delayed and attenuated N290 wave. When
   compared with either healthy subjects or with patients with normal
   memory, the responses in patients with abnormal memory showed an
   abnormal 'positive shift' between 262 and 315 ms after probe
   presentation and a further positive shift between 315 and 420 ms as
   memory load increased. These abnormalities of 'memory scanning' ERPs in
   patients with TLE which paralleled neuropsychological and behavioural
   evidence of memory dysfunction, and which occurred in the section of the
   response that is sensitive to memory loading in healthy subjects,
   provide further objective evidence that abnormalities of short term
   memory processes contribute to the memory deficits of TLE.

AB Electronic toll collection (ETC) offers the opportunity for toll
   facility operators to supply a substantially greater amount of traffic
   capacity than any other currently available form of toll collection. 
   The current interest in ETC derives from the proposals in a number of
   countries to introduce urban tollways, using the net toll receipts to
   recover the cost of the capital investment plus an acceptable profit
   margin for those taking the financial risk.  This paper outlines the
   main economic, technical, and administrative features of ETC in the
   context of toll charges that are determined by the rules of capital cost
   recovery.  Electronic road pricing (ERP) as a mechanism for implementing
   full road user charging (in line with economic principles of efficient
   use of road space) is not the topic of this paper, given the
   predominantly financial basis of setting tolls for private roads.  The
   underlying rationale for tollroads in the political climate of most
   nations is not suggestive of any plan to revise the pricing regime in
   line with ERP upon reversion of the infrastructure to the public sector
   when the capital costs are repaid.  It is assumed that the tollroads
   will revert to free roads in line with the existing road system, and
   that road users will continue to contribute towards the costs of
   maintaining the road system by the traditional pricing mechanisms (i.e.
   fuel taxes, vehicle registration, fees, etc.).
