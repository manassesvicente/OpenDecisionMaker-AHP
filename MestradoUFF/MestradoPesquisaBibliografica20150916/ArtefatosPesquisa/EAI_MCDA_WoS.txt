AB Mining operations usually comprise a spread spectrum of environmental
   challenges, which are often unique to each mine site. This is due to the
   fact that mining activities, directly or indirectly, have an adverse
   impact on environment and ecology. For this reason, the environmental
   impact assessment (EIA) process has been developed for evaluation of the
   possible impact of mine development and operations on the environment,
   including the natural, social and economic aspects. In this article, an
   EIA methodology based on analytic network process and fuzzy simple
   additive weight (SAW) is proposed to formulate the environmental risks
   pertaining to mining projects. In the system of the proposed model, the
   importance weights are calculated by an ANP process. Then, fuzzy SAW is
   employed to evaluate the preference ratings of the alternatives. The
   merit of using fuzzy logic is to handle the inherent uncertainty in
   modelling an EIA problem by simplifying the sophisticated structure of
   the problem under consideration. The proposed model is utilised to
   assess the environmental impact generated by zinc and lead mining
   projects located in Zanjan, Iran to shape the future industrial and
   mining structure of the region. Finally, the environmental impacts are
   ranked from the most to the least risky.
