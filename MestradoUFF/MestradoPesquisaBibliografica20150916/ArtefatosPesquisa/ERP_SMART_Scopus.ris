AB  - The distribution automation system (DAS) is vulnerable to cyber-attacks due to the widespread use of terminal devices and standard communication protocols. On account of the cost of defense, it is impossible to ensure the security of every device in the DAS. Given this background, a novel quantitative vulnerability assessment model of cyber security for DAS is developed in this paper. In the assessment model, the potential physical consequences of cyber-attacks are analyzed from two levels: terminal device level and control center server level. Then, the attack process is modeled based on game theory and the relationships among different vulnerabilities are analyzed by introducing a vulnerability adjacency matrix. Finally, the application process of the proposed methodology is illustrated through a case study based on bus 2 of the Roy Billinton Test System (RBTS). The results demonstrate the reasonability and effectiveness of the proposed methodology. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Construction was completed during summer 2013 on the Telescope Array RAdar (TARA) bi-static radar observatory for Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR). TARA is co-located with the Telescope Array, the largest "conventional" cosmic ray detector in the Northern Hemisphere, in radio-quiet Western Utah. TARA employs an 8 MW Effective Radiated Power (ERP) VHF transmitter and smart receiver system based on a 250 MS/s data acquisition system in an effort to detect the scatter of sounding radiation by UHECR-induced atmospheric ionization. TARA seeks to demonstrate bi-static radar as a useful new remote sensing technique for UHECRs. In this report, we describe the design and performance of the TARA transmitter and receiver systems. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Internet of Things, otherwise known as IoT, IPv6 or Industr y 4.0 is going to become wider, linking 25 billion smart devices and intelligent systems in operation around the world. Ethernet-based networks, such as EtherCAT, allow every part of an automation system, from sensors to robots, to exchange information at high speeds. This gives the controller instant access to every detail of production information. Once this controller is also connected to the enterprise-level Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP) or Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES). End-user IT departments will have to work more closely with engineering to allow shop-floor equipment to have direct access to enterprise-level systems without the use of middleware. The latest controllers, such as Omron's Sysmac NJ series, combine the reliability and rugged design of a traditional PLC, but use an open hardware architecture combined with software ?engines' within a single CPU, rather than multiple CPUs, to manage their different functions. Ricoh plans to use similar instant communication with an enterprise-level database to scan codes on used toner cartridges sent to its Telford site for recycling. In this case, an NJ controller will allow data, including the number of previous refills, to be checked. This will in turn enable the system to determine whether any given cartridge should be refilled again, while also updating the database. The FAG SmartCheck from Schaeffler FAG recognises and reports the first vibrations of a system long before any noise is generated. That means there is substantially longer time to react before the machine fails.

AB  - Advanced metering system (AMI) is a new advanced metering system for the two-way measurement and interaction operation in Smart Grid, single-phase power quality parameters measurement has become one of the most attractive research topics in recent years. A CS approach based on two-dimensional image compression for power quality analysis is proposed. Since the sampling information of power quality (PQ) has outstanding frequency-domain sparse characteristics; it can be applied into the analysis of theoretical model with two-dimensional image compression algorithm using compressed sensing (CS). According to the single-phase power quality measurement using compressed sensing, a two-dimensional sparse measurement model on voltage, current and power signals is established. Only a few amount of points of electrical state power signal is sampled. Using these samples, power signal is recovered in order to effectively detect the operating status of the power quality parameters involving harmonic, instantaneous power disturbance, etc. The performance of the proposed approach and other different schemes are compared through numerical experiments and analysis of compression sampling ratio (CSR), signal to noise ratio (SNR), mean squared error (MSE), energy recovery percentage (ERP). Numerical results have shown that CS based power quality analysis approach behaves extremely well in practice.

AB  - There are a variety of economic and ecological benefits to increased resource efficiency. Social, institutional and technical innovations can all contribute towards efficiency increases. Companies face different hurdles in fostering such innovation. Small and medium-sized companies are subject to specific constraints that may prevent them from benefiting from innovation-induced resource efficiency improvements. Qualitative interviews were conducted among German small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and intermediaries to identify barriers for resource efficiency innovations and to elaborate a policy mix at the federal level that could help SMEs to overcome these. We found five major barriers to resource efficiency innovations in German SMEs, comprising deficits in innovation culture, inter-firm cooperation along the value chain, finance, awareness and take-up of government funds. We propose a distinct policy mix as a response to this situation. The policy mix comprises the interlocking and synergistic elements of government funding schemes, innovation agents and innovation laboratories.

AB  - The present study examined the transfer of higher-order cognitive strategy training to inhibitory control. Middle school students enrolled in a comprehension- and reasoning-focused cognitive strategy training program and passive controls participated. The training program taught students a set of steps for inferring essential gist or themes from materials. Both before and after training or a comparable duration in the case of the passive controls, participants completed a semantically cued Go/No-Go task that was designed to assess the effects of depth of semantic processing on response inhibition and components of event-related potentials (ERP) related to response inhibition. Depth of semantic processing was manipulated by varying the level of semantic categorization required for response selection and inhibition. The SMART-trained group showed inhibitory control gains and changes in fronto-central P3 ERP amplitudes on inhibition trials; whereas, the control group did not. The results provide evidence of the transfer of higher-order cognitive strategy training to inhibitory control and modulation of ERPs associated with semantically cued inhibitory control. The findings are discussed in terms of implications for cognitive strategy training, models of cognitive abilities, and education. © 2013.

AB  - Capturing and processing of real-time manufacturing shop floor field data is essential in improving the performance of shop floor planning, execution and control. Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) has enabled real-time information visibility and realized ubiquitous manufacturing enterprises with proper functionalities of Enterprise Information Systems (EISs). This paper presents a flexible, modularized and re-configurable framework for the new generation RFID middleware system, named Gateway Operating System (GOS). It is an overall software solution designed and proposed not only to address basic functions of RFID middleware system, but also to overcome the particular challenges and requirements for real-life manufacturing scenarios. GOS aims to provide an easy-to-deploy, simple-to-use and affordable RFID middleware solution for manufacturing applications. A multi-agent based model, named gateway smart agent manager, is designed to enable the heterogeneous RFID devices in a "Plug and Play" fashion and to cope with the changes from these connected hardware devices. To guarantee the versatility and scalability of GOS, an XML (eXtensible Markup Language) based message exchanging protocol is designed to fulfill the communication and interactions between applications and devices. Based on this protocol, an easy-to-deploy and simple-to-use application manager is built to manage, configure and use the connected devices as well as deployed applications. The proposed GOS will provide a new referenced framework for the development of lightweight RFID middleware system for manufacturing environment. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Enterprise resource planning (ERP) software gathers and disseminates critical management information across your entire organization. Assembly-specific ERP software can ensure consistent quality and greater traceability within the processes. It can enhance tracking of routing structures and help you identify product availability and costs at each stage of production. It can increase inventory control, including better forecasting, tracking and material planning for improved purchasing decisions and just-in-time assembly. Key features include integration, scalability, ease of use, mobile interfacing, real-time data access, and industry-specific functions. To give manufacturers a complete picture of their business, ERP software must be fully integrated with any other software that shares the same data. The ERP system should be able to grow within company in terms of both modules and number of users. A good ERP system should have apps to take advantage of smart phones, scanners and other electronic devices.

AB  - Patients suffering from severe motor disabilities are usually dependent on assistance from other people to engage in rehabilitation exercises, making the rehabilitation process time-consuming and inconvenient. We propose an automatic feature extraction method for a brain-machine interface that allows patients to control a robot using their own brain waves. A brain-machine interface (BMI) based on the P300 event-related potential (ERP), called the Brain Controlled Rehabilitation System (BCRS), was developed to detect patient intentions. Using the BCRS, patients can communicate with the robot through their brain waves. However, obtaining an automatically extracted, useful EEG signal is a difficult and important problem for BMI research. In this paper, Independent Component Analysis - Multiple Kernel Learning (ICA-MKL) is used to directly extract a useful signal and build the classification mode for BCRS. The results reveal that this method is useful for automatically extracting the P300 signal and improves on the accuracy of MKL. In addition, the same method can be extended to any motor imagery area. The ICA-MKL approach for brain imagery data also effectively removes eye-blink artifacts. © 2013 International Journal of Automation and Smart Technology.

AB  - Hadoop is although becoming a core component of most organizations' big data strategies, but it's not mature enough to completely replace enterprise data warehouse (EDW). Most Hadoop environments lack the robust security, availability, and governance that are standard in a mature EDW. Hadoop can supplement, rather than replace, the analytic sandboxes an organization has implemented to support modeling with tools such as IBM SPSS, which of ten focus on more traditional structured data from customer relationship management and enterprise resource planning systems. Some operational Hadoop deployments may figure into larger application-consolidation initiatives, and may involve integration of Hadoop/MapReduce runtimes for analytical off load from online transaction processing, semantic web, and decision automation environments.

AB  - In the overall plan for the smart grid by State Grid Corporation, the life-cycle asset management (EAM) system is the main part of the development of state grid enterprise resource planning (ERP). From the point of view of construction rules of the complex information system, based on the IEC 61970/61968 common information model (CIM), the asset information model theory is described and the difference between power system resources and asset is analyzed. The disciplines and methods for the electric power information modeling are presented and used to extend to the asset information model. The asset information model includes the base model and operation model, of which the former describes equipment records while the latter covers the inspection and maintenance data. Various applications of the asset model are discussed, such as asset database design, asset classification and coding design. Moreover, the integration scheme of asset management with materials and financial management is roughly studied. © 2012 State Grid Electric Power Research Institute Press.

AB  - In recent years, the evolution of infrastructures and technologies carried out by emerging paradigms, such as Cloud Computing, Future Internet and SaaS (Software-as-a-Service), is leading the area of enterprise systems to a progressive, significant transformation process. This evolution is characterized by two aspects: a progressive commoditization of the traditional ES functions, with the 'usual' management and planning of resources, while the challenge is shifted toward the support to enterprise innovation. This process will be accelerated by the advent of FInES (Future Internet Enterprise System) research initiatives, where different scientific disciplines converge, together with empirical practices, engineering techniques and technological solutions. All together they aim at revisiting the development methods and architectures of the Future Enterprise Systems, according to the different articulations that Future Internet Systems (FIS) are assuming, to achieve the Future Internet Enterprise Systems (FInES). In particular, this paper foresees a progressive implementation of a rich, complex, articulated digital world that reflects the real business world, where computational elements, referred to as FInER (Future Internet Enterprise Resources), will directly act and evolve according to what exists in the real world. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Information technology (IT) involve a wide set of risks. Enterprise information systems are a major developing form of information technology involving their own set of risks, thus creating potential blind spots. This paper describes risk management issues involved in enterprise resource planning systems (ERP) which have high impact on organizations due to their high cost, and their pervasive impact on organizational operations. Alternative means of acquiring ERP systems, to include outsourcing to application service providers (ASPs) are available. But outsourcing ERP involves many risks that are often overlooked. After identification of typical risks involved with representative alternative forms of ERP, multiple criteria analysis is proposed as a useful tool for tradeoff analysis in this selection decision. SMART is compared with popular approaches such as DEA and PCA- based DEA. A demonstration of how multiple criteria analysis can be applied in the international ERP alternative selection decision is given by including outsourcing to China and South Korea. © 2011 World Scientific Publishing Co. & Operational Research Society of Singapore.

AB  - This paper outlines the application of case-based reasoning and Bayesian belief networks to critical success factor (CSF) assessment for parsimonious military decision making. An important factor for successful military missions is information superiority (IS). However, IS is not solely about minimising information related needs to avoid information overload and the reduction of bandwidth but it is also concerned with creating information related capabilities that are aligned with achieving operational effects and raising operational tempo. Moreover, good military decision making, should take into account the uncertainty inherent in operational situations. Herein, we illustrate the development and evaluation of a smart decision support system (SDSS) that dynamically identifies and assesses CSFs in military scenarios and as such de-clutters the decision making process. The second contribution of this work is an automated configuration of conditional probability tables from hard data generated from simulations of military operational scenarios using a computer generated forces (CGF) synthetic environment. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Radio frequency identification (RFID) technology has long been known for its ability to uniquely identify objects. Recent years have witnessed a significant increase in storage capacity on the tag, which is giving rise to a new set of application scenarios. As the tag itself can carry relevant context information, processes can be managed locally rather than relying on a centralised system infrastructure. This in turn results in a massive interoperability challenge. We propose to solve this problem by combining RFID technology with ontologies to create smart objects in the context of manufacturing process control. The idea is to store information originating from an SAP ERP system using the PSL Ontology (ISO 18629) for representing processes and time directly on the RFID tags. As an item flows through a manufacturing process, information about the item can be stored on its tag. This information, along with the PSL axioms, can be used to make inferences about the manufacturing process and the item in particular. In this paper, we discuss our formalisation of an ontology for the SAP data model and show an example of translating data from an SAP ERP system into PSL axioms, and answering queries about a manufacturing process. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Hospitals require better information connectivity because timing and content of the information to be traded is critical. The imperative success in the past has generated renewed thrust on the expectations and credibility of the current enterprise resource planning (ERP) applications in health care. The desire to bring improved connectivity and to match it with critical timing remains the penultimate dream. Currently, majority of ERP system integrators are not able to match these requirements of the healthcare industry. It is perceived that the concept of ERP has made the process of segregating bills and patient records much easier. Hence the industry is able to save more lives, but at the cost of an individual's privacy as it enables to access the database of patients and medical histories through the common database shared by hospitals though at a quicker rate. Businesses such as health care providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and distributors have already implemented rapid ERPs. The new concept "Smart Pharmacies" will link the process all the way from drug delivery, patient care, demand management, drug repository, and pharmaceutical manufacturers while maintaining Regulatory Compliances and make the vital connections where these Businesses will talk to each other electronically.

AB  - The home automation market is characterized by the great number of systems available to the end user. The recent bubble in the building industry made the situation even worse due to the birth of new proprietary systems. The success of the digital home concept depends on the ease of integration between home automation systems and other consumer electronic equipment pre-existing in the home. In this paper the interoperability issue is addressed and the approach followed in the project DomoEsi is presented.

AB  - Positioning technologies that use global system for mobile communication (GSM) networks for location estimation (such as the privacy observant location system (POLS) and the place lab framework) lack the accuracy that other positioning technologies like the global positioning system (GPS) have. GPS receivers are most of the time capable of placing a person within 10 m of a known location. Place Lab is an open platform framework implemented in Java for client-side location sensing that can calculate a position estimate from various beacon sources, such as GSM beacons. The POLS framework is a counterpart of Place Lab for Windows Smartphone devices which provide the tools to develop location-based services quickly. There is a lack of accuracy, however, when the location estimation algorithm uses only GSM readings. Measurements that have been made with Place Lab show a median accuracy of 232 m in downtown areas. Place Lab and POLS do not need additional hardware, apart from the mobile phone itself, however, their lack of accuracy compared to GPS is significant. Due to this rather poor accuracy, the use of those frameworks is limited to applications where the accuracy is not crucial. This article presents the results of improving the accuracy of location estimation in urban areas by extending the algorithm used in the POLS and Place Lab frameworks to take into account the beacon properties, effective radiated power (ERP) and beacon height when estimating a position. The extended algorithm based on beacon properties outperforms the centroid algorithm by over 30%.

AB  - Lean manufacturing tools along with right automation system can play a significant role in improving productivity. Smart applications of automation or deployment of systems having automated and lean features along with flexible manufacturing systems can be used as per factory operation's requirement. A proper testing need to be carried out before deployment of any lean automation systems. Manufacturers, who are planning to deploy lean principles to automated system, are advised to perform Plan, Do, Check, Act (PDCA) steps before implementing a lean automation system. Manufacturers also need to adopt those flexible automation systems, that are easy for modification and can improve the process, productivity, save time, and reduce errors. Intelligent robots with latest vision can provide higher degree of flexibility for automation in lean environments.

AB  - Through an analysis on disabled people data and because of a specific request of families and associations of disabled people in Italy, it emerged the necessity to design new home solutions. Theirs goals are the improvements of the autonomy and of the quality of users' life in their own homes instead of in health care institutions. CUnEdI of the University of Trento developed a methodology of participated interdisciplinary design for smart homes for disabled users. This paper refers to the case study called "Casa satellite" a home solution designed for people suffering from Down syndrome. "Casa satellite" is a pilot project which aims to educate the users to an independent living by mean of a training period in the experimental dwelling. This apartment combines accessibility and automation system in order to facilitate the activities inside the home, to assure safety and security, to permit the remote connection with assistance services.

AB  - Software process operators are considering the integration of real-time events on the shop-floor and factory site up into business planning environments. Simon Pollard, vice president, Manufacturing Operations and Execution, SAP EMEA, stated that customers in the process sector are targeting a natural evolution of the enterprise model rather than the plant model. A key software player SAP is increasing its market presence throughout the process industries with focus on the ERP/enterprise business planning and execution functions, and over the last two to three years the company has started to work with major customers to integrate plant-to-enterprise business scenarios. The efforts should be focused on understanding potential benefits, in the context of a guiding principle or manufacturing philosophies such as lean, JIT and Six Sigma. Smart industry-specific, real-time integration scenarios is aimed towards benefits such as reduced cost, latency, waste, or improved return on assets.

AB  - Collaborative commerce and design environment (CCDE) is characterized by its numerous users, massive resources and dynamic changes. In order to solve security problems coming from multi-domain, heterogeneity and dynamics, the security policies for CCDE were introduced. The security architecture for CCDE was constructed, which employed user proxy and resource proxy to provide resource and security access control. On the premise that the access control mechanism of each individual security domain was not changed in CCDE, secure resource access could be accomplished in cross-heterogeneous domains. The security of collaborative commerce and design activities were guaranteed and at the same time easy use of resource access was provided. At last, the framework of key supporting technologies of CCDE was also introduced.

AB  - We investigate the concept of Smart Business Networks by using Beer's Viable System Model (VSM) to analyse how such a network mitigates the affect of emergent, and therefore unforecastable, demands upon the networked businesses. We examine the requirements for network smartness, highlight some significant properties of one Smart Network and use our case analysis and concepts from systems theory to suggest some general properties such as natural stability and distributed capability. We have found that smartness is distributed and shared behavioural process standards can act to stabilise complex systems. This is important because it mitigates emergent behaviour within increasingly complex business networks. The contributions of our article apply both to academics and business practitioners and are in its illustration and investigation of one Smart Business Network including how the smart capability functions at a strategic, business process and technical level; and the use of Beer's VSM to analyse an electricity market.

AB  - The product lifecycle management (PLM) system provides a collaborative environment to manage, track and control all the product-related information over the complete product and asset life cycle. PLM offers functions for creating and sharing product planning, designing, manufacturing and distribution information for collaboration via local networks and the Internet. PLM pulls relevant information from the CAX, ERP, SCM and CRM systems, and associates with product knowledge. It shares the product data across all company functions, customers and suppliers, and makes the product data available to extended enterprises. It empowers everyone from manufacturing to marketing and from purchasing to field supporting to work faster and smarter. This paper describes a four layers framework of PLM system, four main technologies including product modeling, integrated data environment, designing and manufacturing collaboration as well as workflow management. The implementation of PLM system with CORAB and WEB techniques is also discussed.

AB  - The big gains from advanced planning and scheduling (APS) irrespective of some unique cases are studied. APS is defined as capability of planning materials and capacity to act simultaneously and fast. Due to misconception they find little use compared to manufacture resource planning systems and enterprise resource planning systems which operate in the same functional mode. However APS has found more takers especially among smart manufacturers who realize that it is best suited to present day manufacturing business. APS system is known for high speed and sophistication that allow manufacturer to deal with high velocity and changeable world of business.

AB  - With the advent of information technology, many mills are shifting towards integrated information management systems. An integrated plant information system converts data into knowledge and when combined with decision support and advanced controls, it provides a means of turning knowledge into profit. Integrated information management consists of emerging technologies dubbed as `smart manufacturing systems.' By combining models with tools to compare current and past operating conditions, planning and scheduling, and advanced controls, a mill can truly maximize its performance.

AB  - The controllable rheological behaviour of Electro-Rheological Fluids (ERP) is useful in engineering systems where variable performance is required. In particular the ERF have properties which are changed by an imposed electric field. In this paper a general ised Reynolds equation is solved using finite element techniques in order to simulate the behaviour of misaligned journal bearings lubricated with ERF. The Bingham plastic model is used to described the behaviour of the ERF, when the fluid is in flow mode. It is found that the applied electric field has a substantial influence on the load carrying capacity and the misaligned attitude of the journal bearings. It is concluded that the electric field imposed on the electro-rheological lubricant tends to align the journal in the bearing, making thus the misalignment angle smaller. Thus by changing the electric field it is possible to control the dynamic behaviour of rotor-bearing systems.
