AB Business intelligence (BI) has been recognized as an important
   enterprise information system to help decision makers achieve
   performance measurement and management. Generally, typical BI users
   consist of financial analysts, marketing planners, and general managers.
   However, most of them are not familiar with BI's core technologies. In
   order to help corporate executives better assess BI vendors, evaluation
   criteria are separated into marketing requirements (MRs) and technical
   attributes (TM), respectively. In particular, a fuzzy MCDM
   (multi-criteria decision making) based QFD (quality function deployment)
   is proposed as follows: (1) fuzzy Delphi is used to aggregate the
   performance scores of BI vendors, (2) fuzzy DEMATEL (decision making and
   trial laboratory) is conducted to recognize the causalities between MRs
   and TAs, and (3) fuzzy AHP (analytical hierarchy process) is employed to
   recommend optimal BI systems. For better benchmarking, the strengths and
   weaknesses of three competitive BI vendors (i.e. SAP, SAS, and
   Microsoft) are concurrently visualized through displaying a line diagram
   (in terms of TM) and a radar diagram (in terms of MRs). More
   importantly, experimental results demonstrate that supplier assessment
   and supplier recommendation have been successfully accomplished. (C)

AB The aim of this paper was to evaluate the risk level for both
   intra-organizational cultures and for different industries in
   implementing an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. This study
   adopts the Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (FANP) method to assess ERP
   implementation risks, which were categorized into four dimensions:
   management and execution, software system, users, and technology
   planning. An empirical survey was conducted that utilized the collected
   survey data of 20 ERP experts in Taiwan to assess, rank, and improve the
   critical risks of ERP implementation via the FANP method. Based on the
   results of the FANP method, a follow-up survey of ERP end-users in
   different departments of three industries was conducted to assess how
   intra-organizational cultures and cross-industries affect users'
   perceived risks a real world scenario. Our research results demonstrated
   that "lack of management support and assistance" is vital risk for a
   successful ERP implementation. Top management support and involvement
   are crucial and essential factors to the success of a firm's ERP
   implementation. "Ineffective communication with users" was found to be
   the second highest risk factor. The benefits of using the FANP method
   for evaluating the risk factors come from the clear priority weights
   between alternatives. Finally, this study provides suggestions to help
   enterprises decrease ERP risks, and enhance the chances of success of
   ERP implementations among intra-organizational cultures and
   across-industries. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a geometric least square framework for deriving [0,
   1]-valued interval weights from interval fuzzy preference relations. By
   analyzing the relationship among [0, 1]-valued interval weights,
   multiplicatively consistent interval judgments, and planes, a geometric
   least square model is developed to derive a normalized [0, 1]-valued
   interval weight vector from an interval fuzzy preference relation. Based
   on the difference ratio between two interval fuzzy preference relations,
   a geometric average difference ratio between one interval fuzzy
   preference relation and the others is defined and employed to determine
   the relative importance weights for individual interval fuzzy preference
   relations. A geometric least square based approach is further put
   forward for solving group decision making problems. An individual
   decision numerical example and a group decision making problem with the
   selection of enterprise resource planning software products are
   furnished to illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of the
   proposed models.

AB As a result of emerging computation technologies, information systems
   are developed to support various processes of enterprises. ERP
   (Enterprise Resource Planning) has been a leading EIS (Enterprise
   Information Systems) application and companies are allocating resources
   to such new projects. However, studies report that most of the projects
   fail or cannot reach the desired outcomes selecting inappropriate
   software is represented as one of the major sources for project
   failures. This paper focuses on EIS selection problem which is a
   multicriteria decision making (MCDM) problem since it contains various
   and conflicting criteria. In this study, a group decision making
   approach using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Interval type-2
   fuzzy sets is used on a real world ERP selection problem with six
   criteria and four alternatives. The originality of the study comes from
   using interval type-2 fuzzy sets in the decision problem. By using
   interval type-2 fuzzy sets for handling fuzzy group decision-making
   problems more flexible decisions can be given since interval type-2
   fuzzy sets are more suitable to represent uncertainties than type-1
   fuzzy set.

AB Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems that aim to integrate,
   synchronize and centralize organizational data are generally regarded as
   a vital tool for companies to be successful in the rapidly changing
   global marketplace. Due to its high acquisition purchasing, installation
   and implementation cost and the wide range of offerings, the selection
   of ERP systems is a strategically important and difficult decision.
   Since there is a wide range of tangible and intangible criteria to be
   considered, it is often defined as a multi-criteria decision making
   problem. To overcome the challenges imposed by the multifaceted nature
   of the problem, herein a three-stage hybrid methodology is proposed. The
   process starts with the identification of most prevailing criteria
   through a series of brainstorming sessions that include people from
   different organizational units. Then, due to the varying importance of
   the criteria, a fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process, which handles the
   vagueness inherent in the decision making process, is used to obtain the
   relative importance/weights of the criteria. These weighted criteria are
   then used as input to the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity
   to Ideal Solution method to rank the decision alternatives. As a
   real-world illustrative case, the proposed methodology is applied to the
   ERP selection problem at Turkish Airlines. Because of the collaborative
   and systematic nature of the methodology, the results obtained from the
   process were found to be highly satisfactory and trustworthy by the
   decision makers. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The ever increasing Internet bandwidth and the fast changing needs of
   businesses for effectiveness with the partners in the procurement chain
   and is leading organizations to adopt information systems
   infrastructures that are cost effective as well as flexible. The
   question seems to be: what is driving organizations to go in for
   Software as a Service (SaaS) based e-procurement and ERP, rather than
   the packaged model of software provisioning? Whereas there have been
   studies reporting technology, cost, quality, network externalities and
   process as the main variables in the utility function of the user, but
   most of the studies have modelled either one or two in the their models.
   The study is exploratory in nature and tries to identify, classify and
   rank dimensions affecting SaaS sourcing decisions. In this study, we
   developed an integrative framework to identify the determinants of
   choice of SaaS in the specific context of SaaS based e-procurement and
   ERP. The framework was then analyzed using the extended Analytic
   Hierarchy Process (AHP) method suggested by Liberatore (1987) and the
   relative importance and the weights of the criteria identified using
   data collected on 8 users and 9 service providers of SaaS based
   e-procurement and ERP. Although the analysis helped in identifying
   quality and costs as the two most important determinants of choice of
   SaaS based e-procurement and ERP, but the other criteria such as network
   externality benefits, technology and process were also found to be
   significant determinants of choice. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Purpose - The semiconductor market exceeded US$250 billion worldwide in
   2010 and has had a double-digit compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in
   the last 20 years. As it is located far upstream of the electronic
   product market, the semiconductor industry has suffered severely from
   the "bullwhip" effect. Therefore, effective e-based supply chain
   management (e-SCM) has become imperative for the efficient operation of
   semiconductor manufacturing (SM) companies. The purpose of this research
   is to define and analyze the key success factors (KSF) for e-SCM system
   implementation in the semiconductor industry.
   Design/methodology/approach - A hierarchy of KSFs is defined first by a
   combination of a literature review and a focus group discussion with
   experts who successfully implemented an inter-organizational e-SCM
   project. Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) is then employed to
   rank the importance of these identified KSFs. To confirm the research
   result and further explore the managerial implications, a second
   in-depth interview with the e-SCM project executives is conducted.
   Findings - The KSF hierarchy is constructed with two levels: a top-level
   consisting of four dimensions and a detailed-level consisting of 15
   individual factors. The research shows that, in the top-level, strategy
   is the most critically successful dimension followed by process,
   organization, and technical; whereas in the detailed-level, the top
   management commitment, clear project goal and business requirements, and
   business process re-engineering are the top three critical successful
   factors.
   Research limitations/implications - Research surveys and interviews were
   conducted with two leading companies: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
   Company (TSMC) and ASE; they are the largest front-end and back-end SM
   companies in the world, respectively. Although the data collected was
   primarily based on the experience of one successful e-SCM project, the
   significant roles of these two companies and compelling contribution
   made by the e-SCM project leading to the research resulted in valuable
   guidelines for the companies in the semiconductor industry and a useful
   reference for companies in other manufacturing industries.
   Originality/value - e-SCM system has a high failure rate and there is
   little literature discussing the KSF of e-SCM implementation from a
   holistic view for certain industries. This paper not only provides a
   structured and comprehensive list of KSFs but also illustrates the
   application of the most critical factors by examples. In addition to the
   contributions made to industries, the research results can also serve as
   a foundation for related academic research when comparing the KSFs of
   implementing e-SCM by different industries.

AB Given significant investments in enterprise resource planning (ERP)
   systems, previous studies report unusually high failure rate and major
   challenges in ERP projects. The activities prior to ERP implementation,
   referred to as the pre-implementation phase, are very important because
   they significantly affect the implementation success. In this paper, the
   pre-implementation phase is focused in which necessary preparations
   before embarking on the ERP initiative, required functions and features,
   and the most appropriate ERP solution are decided. Such decisions are
   risky, costly, and very time-consuming because they necessitate working
   with a vast amount of information and require appropriate analytical
   capabilities as well as decision making methods and structures. In this
   paper, a comprehensive decision support system (DSS) is developed
   helping organisations to make the targeted decisions both efficiently
   and effectively. The proposed framework is applied in a real case study
   to illustrate its effectiveness and practicality.

   possible occurrence ratings of success or failure outcome amongst

   procedures because this proposed approach allows every decision expert
   to choose an explicit criterion or alternative for the without
   restriction. When there are n criteria in a decision matrix, only n - 1
   times of pairwise comparisons are taken. This approach not only improves
   the efficiency of pairwise comparison compared with the traditional AHP,
   but also avoids the checking the consistency of linguistic preference

AB An enterprise resource planning (ERP) system is a software solution that
   puts together a package that allows information flow through various
   levels and departments of an organisation. Manufacturing enterprises
   have understood the importance of information systems within their
   organisations and have begun using them extensively. To achieve the
   right fit of the ERP system to the business organisation, customisation
   may be needed. However, customisation is seen as an issue in the
   application of an ERP. There are many attributes that can be considered
   for the selection of an ERP system. In this paper, we have applied fuzzy
   analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) to a framework to evaluate an ERP
   for implementation purposes. The framework provides different methods
   for customisation of ERP. With the use of FAHP, obtained results provide
   a better match in terms of understanding the problem and giving options
   that are a closer fit to the requirements rather than providing the
   'correct' decision to be taken. This paper is aimed at helping managers
   to understand and select among the various customisation options
   available. The application of FAHP to the framework is demonstrated with
   opinions gathered from managers in various companies. These opinions are
   translated into numerical values and are compared to the problem as a
   whole.

AB Until recently, organizations willing to acquire application systems
   have had no choice but to adopt proprietary software. With the advent of
   open-source software (OSS), a new model for developing and distributing
   software has entered the stage. OSS has evolved from a generally
   horizontal infrastructure towards more highly visible applications in
   vertical domains, giving information systems (IS) managers more degrees
   of freedom in their selection of enterprise application software (EAS).
   Although a large body of research exists on the relative importance of
   evaluation criteria for proprietary EAS, the role of OSS in the EAS
   evaluation process has received little attention so far. To address this
   research gap, this study represents the first empirical investigation to
   compare the relative importance of evaluation criteria in proprietary
   and open-source EAS selection. Through an online survey, we evaluated
   the responses of IS managers of 358 organizations to a conjoint study
   spawning 8592 trade-off pair comparisons and 3580 purchase evaluations
   on proprietary and open-source enterprise resource planning (ERP) and
   Office software packages. The results show that the relative importance
   of evaluation criteria significantly varies between proprietary and
   open-source ERP systems. Implementation factors such as ease of
   implementation and support are much more crucial in the evaluation of
   open-source than of proprietary ERP systems, which is generally due to
   IS managers' risk mitigation behaviour. Interestingly, there are no
   major differences in the ranking of evaluation criteria between
   proprietary and open-source Office systems. We conclude our paper with a
   detailed discussion of our findings and their implications for
   researchers, companies, EAS vendors and open-source communities.

AB Asus Tech, is the largest motherboard manufacturer in Taiwan. Hundreds
   of suppliers cooperate with the company in business. So that supplier
   selection is the most important function of a purchasing department in
   the enterprise. An enterprise resource planning (ERP) system in the
   process of supplier selection may result in the great savings in both
   costs and man hours. In the concept of push and pull, an ERP system acts
   as an efficient tool in the resource integration and profit creation for
   a company. Through ERP, a decision manager can clearly realize the
   strength and weakness of the purchasing operation. To establish a
   real-time purchasing environment, a methodology of analytic network
   process (ANP), technique for order preference by similarity to ideal
   solution (TOPSIS) and linear programming (LP) are effectively applied in
   the supplier selection process. ANP and TOPSIS are used to calculate the
   weight and give suppliers a ranking; LP effectively allocates order
   quantity to each vendor. As to the result, four PC board suppliers are
   given orders for 1200, 727, 1000 and 73 pieces. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems cannot remain static after
   their implementation, they need maintenance. ERP maintenance is a key
   process required by the rapidly changing business environment and the
   usual software maintenance needs. However, these projects are highly
   complex and risky. So, the risks management associated with ERP
   maintenance projects is crucial to attain a satisfactory performance.
   Unfortunately, ERP maintenance risks have not been studied in depth. For
   this reason, this paper presents a general risks taxonomy. It gathers
   together the risks affecting the performance of ERP maintenance.
   Moreover, the authors use the analytic hierarchy process (AHP)
   methodology to analyze the risks factors identified. It helps managers,
   vendors, consultants, auditors, users and IT staff to manage ERP
   maintenance better. Results suggest that the most critical stage in ERP
   maintenance is the first phase, which receives, identifies, classifies
   and ranks the software modification. The most important hazards in ERP
   maintenance are the cooperation and commitment of ERP users and
   managers. Crown Copyright (c) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights

   decision makers to calculate and compare risk evolution at fixed points
   of the change cycle and make structured and balanced risk mitigation
   decisions.
   Enterprise Resource Planning systems evolution initiatives in
   distribution companies are a model example of the defined problem. The
   ORE framework is customized into the ERP-ORE framework to demonstrate
   its application. The ERP-ORE framework emphasizes the political and
   process dimensions of systems evolution and utilizes the Analytic
   Hierarchy Process to enable management to make disciplined risk
   mitigation decisions. The ERP-ORE framework is illustrated through a
   case study description of a medical supplies distributor implementing an
   ERP system. The focus is on the ERP system's role as an information

AB Outsourcing can be seen as a strategic way to align technology
   initiatives and business goals, as a strategy for managing technology
   operations in today's difficult business environment, and as a way to
   reduce operating costs. Often, companies begin the process by
   outsourcing non-core business operations, which may include
   applications, assets, people and other resources. The outsourcing
   decision is important since the correct selection can dramatically
   increase a firm's performance. When companies outsource a significant
   part of their business and become more dependent on outsourcers, the
   consequences of poor decision making becomes more severe. Since
   enterprise resource planning (ERP) is one of the vital systems, if not
   the one, that integrates all functions including planning,
   manufacturing, distribution, and accounting into a single system, its
   outsourcing is a very important multi-attribute decision problem for the
   firms. In the literature, outsourcing decisions are often based on
   multi-criteria approaches. In this paper, a fuzzy multi-criteria
   decision making methodology is suggested for the selection among ERP
   outsourcing alternatives. The methodology is based on the analytic
   hierarchy process (AHP) under fuzziness. It allows decision-makers to
   express their evaluations in linguistic expressions, crisp or fuzzy
   numbers. In the application of the proposed methodology, an automotive
   firm selects the best alternative among three ERP outsourcing firms.

AB Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software selection is one of the most
   important decision making issues covering both qualitative and
   quantitative factors for organizations. Multiple criteria decision
   making (MCDM) has been found to be a useful approach to analyze these
   conflicting factors. Qualitative criteria are often accompanied by
   ambiguities and vagueness. This makes fuzzy logic a more natural
   approach to this kind of problems. This study presents a beneficial
   structure to the managers for use in ERP software vendor selection
   process. In order to evaluate ERP vendors methodologically, a
   hierarchical framework is also proposed. As a MCDM tool, we used
   analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and its fuzzy extension to obtain more
   decisive judgments by prioritizing criteria and assigning weights to the
   alternatives. The objective of this paper is to select the most
   appropriate alternative that meets the customer's requirements with
   respect to cost and quality constraints. In the end of this study, a

AB An enterprise resource planning (ERP) software selection is known to be
   multi attribute decision making (MADM) problem. This problem has been
   modeled according with analytic network process (ANP) method due to Tact
   that it considers criteria and sub criteria relations and interrelations
   in selecting the software.
   Opinions of many experts are obtained while building ANP model for the
   selection ERP then opinions arc reduced to one single value by methods
   like geometric means so as to get desired results. To use ANP model for
   the selection of ERP for a new organization, a new group of expert's
   opinions are needed. In this case the same problem will be in counter.
   In the proposed model, when ANP and ANN models are setup, an ERP
   software selection can be made easily by the opinions of one single
   expert. In that case calculation of geometric mean of answers that
   obtained from many experts will be unnecessary. Additionally the effect
   of subjective opinion of one single decision maker will be avoided. In
   terms of difficulty, ANP has some difficulties due to eigenvalue and
   their limit value calculation.
   An ANN model has been designed and trained with using ANP results in
   order to calculate ERP software priority. The artificial neural network
   (ANN) model is trained by results obtained from ANP. It seems that there
   is no any major difficulty in order to predict software priorities with

AB Enterprise resource planning (ERP) system selection is very important
   for a company as it completely affects production and service
   methodology of enterprises. Moreover, ERP selection is getting
   increasingly difficult because of a large variety of ERP software
   solutions available. The current study aims to select the most
   appropriate software between two elected candidates after some analysis
   for the final decision by using a technique with analytic hierarchy
   process (AHP) support in a factory which is planning to use ERP software
   that fits its functions.

AB Previous methods for enterprise software selection generally take into
   account the attributes that are restricted to some financial factors,
   such as costs and benefits. However, the literature lacks studies on
   considering the evaluation of both functional and non-functional
   suitability of software alternatives versus various requirements. This
   study presents a new decision support system for combining these two
   kinds of evaluation to select suitable enterprise software. A
   hierarchical objective structure that contains both qualitative and
   quantitative objectives is proposed to evaluate software products
   systematically. This approach uses a heuristic algorithm, a fuzzy
   multi-criteria decision making procedure and a multi-objective
   programming model to make final selection decision. All the phases of
   presented method are applied in an electronic company's ERP software
   selection project to validate it with a real application. The
   satisfactory results are obtained during this project. The company can
   select the right software to fit its business processes instead of
   adapting its business processes to fit the software. (C) 2008 Elsevier

AB Retailing is a diverse and dynamic industry offering a wide range of
   goods and services to consumers. There is also an increasing recognition
   that this corporate retail power is the driving force for the whole of
   the supply chain. Due to these facts, it is argued that retailing
   companies have a huge potential to impact on sustainability performance
   of national economies. In order to materialize this potential,
   performance in sustainability should be assessed, and evaluating
   sustainability performance of an industry requires developing a system
   of performance evaluation framework. In the context of sustainable
   development, selecting proper sustainability indicators are one of the
   most crucial steps to fulfill performance evaluations. Since there has
   been no attempt to develop proper sustainability indicators in retailing
   industry, this paper aims to select appropriate indicators for future
   evaluation of industrial sustainability performance for grocery
   retailing in terms of three sustainability aspects: social,
   environmental and economic. To this end, (1 a comprehensive analysis of
   the existing literature was done, (2) and Analytic Hierarchy
   Process/Weighted Additive model-based table was developed to rank the
   indicators for each aspect, (3) the input for the tables was obtained
   from rapidly growing grocery retailing industry in Turkey by conducting
   surveys, and (4) using the average values of the tables, sustainability
   indicators for each aspect were ranked and the most appropriate ones
   were selected. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP

AB Software development is an inherently uncertain activity. To deal with
   the uncertainty and vagueness from humans' subjective perception and
   experience in decision process, this paper presents an evaluation model
   based on the fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method for
   measuring the performance of software development projects. In an MCDM
   problem, a decision maker (DM) has to choose the best alternative that
   satisfies the evaluation criteria among a set of candidate solutions. It
   is generally hard to find an alternative that meets all the criteria
   simultaneously, so a good compromise solution is preferred. This problem
   may become more complex when multiple DMs are involved, each having not
   a common perception on the alternatives. Recently, a compromise ranking
   method (known as the VIKOR method) has been proposed to identify such
   compromise solutions, by providing a maximum group utility for the
   majority and a minimum of an individual regret for the opponent. In its
   actual setting, the method treats exact values for the assessment of the
   alternatives, which can be quite restrictive with unquantifiable
   criteria. This will be true especially if the evaluation is made by
   means of linguistic terms. For this reason we extend the VIKOR method so
   as to process such data and to provide a more comprehensive evaluation
   in a fuzzy environment. To demonstrate the potential of the methodology,
   the proposed extension is used for measuring the performance of
   enterprise resource planning (ERP) software products. (C) 2007 IMACS.

AB An enterprise resource planning (ERP) system is a critical investment
   that can significantly affect future competitiveness and performance of
   a company. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method is often applied
   to select an ERP system since it is well suited to multiple criteria
   decision-making problems. This study presents a simulation-based AHP
   (SiAHP) method for group decision making and is applied to the
   real-world problem of selecting a suitable ERP system for a Korean
   homeshopping company. To enhance the fitness of a group AHP method and
   to facilitate the ERP system selection process, this paper proposes a
   simulation-based approach for building a group consensus instead of
   forming point estimates that are aggregated from individual preference
   judgments. To be specific, the proposed method is based on observations
   from empirically observed frequency distributions and does not use
   aggregation procedures, compared to typical group AHP for obtaining a
   group solution. This approach, reflecting the diversification of group
   members' opinions as they are, is conceived to be useful as a tool for
   obtaining insights into agreements and disagreements with respect to the
   alternatives among the individuals of a group. The real-world example
   demonstrates the feasibility of our proposed approach.

   to measure the operational efficiency of companies utilizing the ERP
   system.  The purpose of this paper is to analyze the operational
   efficiency of small and medium companies using Data Envelopment Analysis
   (DEA). We used CCR, BCC, Super-efficiency and Slack based measure (SBM)
   model in terms of the DEA model to measure the operational efficiency of
   nine Automobile parts companies.  Since the traditional method based on
   a measurement model(CCR, BCC) has some problems in not taking account of
   the existence of slack inputs and outputs in several efficient units, we
   attempted to measure the exact amount of efficiency and inefficiency of
   the companies and to do a rank analysis of many efficient units through
   the slacks-based measure model (SBM).

AB During the implementations of enterprise resource planning (ERP)
   systems, most companies have experienced some problems, one of which is
   how to determine the best ERP software satisfying their needs and
   expectations. Because improperly selected ERP software may have an
   impact on the time required, and the costs and market share of a
   company, selecting the best desirable ERP software has been the most
   critical problem for a long time. On the other hand, selecting ERP
   software is a multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem, and in
   the literature, many methods have been introduced to evaluate this kind
   of problem, one of which is the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), which
   has been widely used in MCDM selection problems. However, in this paper,
   we use a fuzzy extension of an analytic network process (ANP), a more
   general form of AHP, which uses uncertain human preferences as input
   information in the decision-making process, because the AHP cannot
   accommodate the variety of interactions, dependencies, and feedback
   between higher- and lower-level elements. Instead of using the classical
   eigenvector prioritization method in the AHP, only employed in the
   prioritization stage of ANP, a fuzzy-logic method providing more
   accuracy on judgements is applied. The resulting fuzzy ANP enhances the
   potential of the conventional ANP for dealing with imprecise and
   uncertain human comparison judgements. In short, in this paper, an
   intelligent approach to ERP software selection through a fuzzy ANP is
   proposed by taking into consideration quantitative and qualitative
   elements to evaluate ERP software alternatives.

AB Enterprise Resource Planning Systems (ERP) have become critical elements
   in the manufacturing field. An ERP system consists of a set of
   managerial tools that support the decision-making process, generate full
   integration among the functional areas of the company, produce high
   levels of productivity in the supply chain and reduce the company costs
   and inventories, among many other benefits. However, the ERP software
   selection process is not an easy task and needs special attention. In
   order to make this process as effective and efficient as possible, a
   model is proposed in this article. This model allows companies to find
   the alternative most suitable for the organization requirements,
   considering the experience of other companies that have already used ERP
   systems in order to obtain efficiency in the selection process as well
   as in the system implementation and operation. The model takes into
   account the expertise from venezuelan companies, that have previously
   implemented ERP software and allow the organization to incorporate their
   specific needs and particular criteria, as input variables. The model
   was developed based on the article: «Factors for the selection of ERP
   software in large manufacturing companies: the venezuelan case» [Castro,
   2004], applying the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and using
   statistical tools as cluster analysis. 
X4 Los sistemas para la planificación de los recursos empresariales ERP se

   gerenciales que soportan el proceso de toma de decisiones, facilitan una
   completa integración de las diferentes áreas de negocio de la compañía,
   contribuyen a generar alta productividad en las cadenas de suministro y
   reducción de costos e inventarios, entre otros muchos beneficios. Por lo
   anterior, la selección del software que soporta los sistemas ERP es un
   paso que necesita gran atención. Con el fin de mejorar la eficiencia y
   efectividad de este proceso de selección, se propone en este trabajo, un
   modelo que permite encontrar la alternativa más adecuada para cada
   organización y lograr la eficiencia en este proceso. El modelo toma en
   cuenta la experiencia de algunas empresas de manufactura en Venezuela,
   que han implantado este tipo de software y permite que cada organización
   incorpore sus necesidades específicas y criterios particulares, como
   variables de entrada. Se utilizaron los factores de selección
   presentados en el artículo «Factors for the selection of ERP software in
   large manufacturing companies: the venezuelan case» [Castro, 2004] y se
   empleó la metodología del proceso de jerarquía analítica utilizando la

AB Since 1995 many enterprises have introduced ERP to strengthen
   competitive power. However, enterprises that have introduced ERP for the
   first time have experienced various types of problems integrating them;
   to this day, there are only a few enterprises that have implemented ERP
   successfully. The main reason for the failures of successful ERP
   implementing is that enterprises frequently ignore and/or don’t know how
   to systematically evaluate the construction process of ERP and busy
   finishing a phase without resolving problems before going on to the next
   phase. This research focused on the implementation process of ERP
   project to evaluate the process of ERP at each phase. As a result, we
   propose an evaluation model of ERP project as a tool to find critical
   problems at each phase and improve on how to resolve the problems found
   at each phase. This evaluation model makes it possible to introduce ERP
   successfully by presenting the basis of assessment which will be used by
   enterprises to minimize the trial and error of construction process of
   ERP.
AK 1995년 이래 많은 기업들이 기업의 경쟁력 확보를 위해 ERP를 도입해 왔다. 그러나 ERP를 도입하려는 기업마다 다른 기업에서
   발생되었던 문제점들을 여전히 경험하고 있으며, 성공적으로 ERP를 도입한 기업은 많지 않다. 이렇게 성공적인 ERP 시스템 구축에
   어려움을 겪는 주요 원인은 체계적인 ERP 구축과정 평가 없이 발생되는 문제점을 간과한 채 다음 단계로 넘어가기 때문이다. 본
   연구에서는 ERP 프로젝트의 결과보다는 구축과정에 초점을 맞추어 ERP 프로젝트 각 단계별 수행과정을 평가하고, 그 결과 발견된
   문제점들을 개선할 수 있는 도구로서 ERP 프로젝트 평가모형을 개발하였다. 이 연구모형은 ERP를 도입하는 기업들에게 구축과정의
   시행착오를 최소화 시킬 수 있는 가이드라인과 단계별 완성도를 높일 수 있는 평가기준을 제시함으로써 성공적인 ERP 도입을 가능하게
   해줄 것이다.

AB Case-based Reasoning (CBR) is widely used in business and industry
   prediction. It is suitable to solve complex and unstructured business
   problems. Recently, the prediction accuracy of CBR has been enhanced by
   not only various machine learning algorithms such as genetic algorithms,
   relative weighting of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) input variable but
   also data mining technique such as feature selection, feature weighting,
   feature transformation, and instance selection As a result, CBR is even
   more widely used today in business area. In this study, we investigated
   the usefulness of the CBR method in forecasting success in implementing
   ERP systems. We used a CBR method based on the feature weighting
   technique to compare the performance of three different models：MDA
   (Multiple Discriminant Analysis), GECBR (GEneral CBR), FWCBR (CBR with
   Feature Weighting supported by Analytic Hierarchy Process). The study
   suggests that the FWCBR approach is a promising method for forecasting
   of successful ERP implementation in Small and Medium sized Enterprises.

AB Recently Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is a key enabler to change
   enterprise more competitive advantage in the Small and Medium sized
   Enterprises (SMEs). However, because of various difficulty during ERP
   system implementation, a successful implementation and operation of ERP
   system is rare. In this study, We suggest a developing model of
   performance measurement on ERP systems implementation process. Firstly,
   We surveyed Critical Success Factors (CSF) of ERP system on prior study.
   Secondly, We make performance measurement model of ERP system using
   Structure Equation Model (SEM) and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) in
   the ERP planning, ERP implementation, Change Management (CM), ERP
   operation and practice respectably. The result suggest a guideline for a
   successful implementation of ERP systems on SMEs
AK 최근 들어 ERP(Enterprise Resource Planning) 시스템은 기업의 경쟁력 강화를 위한 핵심 성과창출 도구로

AB Various figures have stated that ERP (enterprise resource planning)
   systems have become one of the largest IT investments in recent years.
   The implementation of ERP system, however, is not an easy task. Previous
   research reports unusually high failure in ERP projects, sometimes
   jeopardizing the core operation of the implementing organization. The
   most famous case is FoxMeyer filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
   Further, ERP systems appear to present unique ongoing risks due to its
   uniqueness. In this study, we used a Delphi method to identify potential
   ERP projects risk factors, and constructed an AHP-based framework to
   analyze and then prioritized the ERP projects risk factors. The result
   reveals that some important risk factors deserve more attention during
   the implementation of ERP projects.

AB Corporations are increasingly implementing enterprise information
   technologies (EITs), because of the costs of maintaining legacy systems
   and the lack of fit of such systems for organization-wide information
   sharing. A new type of EIT that is being introduced in major
   corporations (such as Dell Computers), is based on the idea of component
   systems, which are stand-alone software programs that can integrate with
   other such components with relative ease. Given the financial outlay for
   EITs, the evaluation and adoption of these systems is not something that
   can be completed haphazardly. This requirement is complicated by the
   relative infancy of models for the evaluation of componentized EITs. To
   this end, in this paper, we introduce a managerial multistage
   multiattribute decision model, consisting of the Analytical Hierarchy
   Process (AHP) model and the Supermatrix approach (also defined as the
   Analytical Network Processes (ANP) approach). This combination of models
   builds on earlier work that validates the Supermatrix approach for
   evaluating traditional EITs at a Fortune 100 organization. The
   aggregation of these benefits is then measured against the costs of
   systems, thereby arriving at a ranking of alternatives for each
   functional area. We illustrate the model with an example and draw
   managerial implications.

AB Along the years, Information Technology (IT) is growing its support role
   to production activities. At first, the activities performed by IT were
   very simple, but nowadays, it supports almost all the production
   activities, including processes and products development. Production
   Planning and Control is a specific area where IT can effectively bring
   significant impacts, opening horizons for new operating strategies and
   even business strategies. Examples of how IT can help the operational
   environment are the use of MRP, MRP II and ERP systems. On the other
   hand, it still remains the doubts about the results obtained with the IT
   investments. In order to evaluate IT impacts on the organization
   operations, it is necessary an approach comparing the results of the IT
   applications related to the objectives, goals and requirements of
   production and of the entire organization, in other words, considering
   the effectiveness of IT applications. This paper reports a case study
   related to the selection of a new IT application in production planning
   in an industry. This research was developed in a large manufacturing
   company and it is discussed IT impacts in the operations management and
   in the organization business. AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) was the
   tool used for the decision-making process. 
Y4 Ao longo dos anos, a Tecnologia da Informação (TI) vem de maneira
   crescente apoiando as atividades mais diretamente ligadas à produção.
   Sendo inicialmente suporte de tarefas mais simples, a TI passa a estar
   presente em todas as etapas do processo produtivo, abrangendo o
   desenvolvimento de produtos e processos. O Planejamento e Controle da
   Produção (PCP) desponta como uma área na qual a TI pode trazer
   significativo impacto nos resultados obtidos, possibilitando novas
   alternativas de estratégias de operações e mesmo de negócios. Os
   sistemas MRP, MRP II e ERP são exemplos de como a TI pode apoiar o PCP.
   Por outro lado, persistem as dúvidas quanto aos resultados obtidos com
   os investimentos em TI. Para avaliar os impactos de tais aplicações nas
   operações, é necessário abordar os resultados obtidos em relação aos
   objetivos, metas e requisitos da área de produção e da empresa como um
   todo, isto é, considerando a eficácia destas aplicações de TI. Este
   estudo apresenta um processo de seleção de alternativas de fornecimento
   de uma nova aplicação de TI voltada ao PCP de uma indústria. A pesquisa
   foi desenvolvida por meio de um estudo de caso em uma indústria de
   grande porte, no qual são discutidos os impactos da TI na gestão da
   operação e do negócio da empresa, bem como o uso do AHP (Analytic
   Hierarchy Process) como ferramenta de apoio à decisão.

AB Cracking the neural code has long been a central issue in neuroscience.
   However, it has been proved difficult because there logically exist an
   infinite number of other models and interpretations that could account
   for the same data and phenomena (i.e. the problem of
   underdetermination). Therefore, I suggest that applying biologically
   realistic multiple constraints from ion-channel level to system level
   (e.g. cognitive neuroscience and human brain disorders) can only solve
   the problem of underdetermination. Here I have explored whether the
   noise shaping/predictive neural coding hypothesis can provide a unified
   view on following realistic multiple constraints: (1) cortical gain
   control mechanisms in vivo; (2) the relationships between acetylcholine,
   nicotine, dopamine, calcium-activated potassium ion-channel, and
   cognitive functions; (3) oscillations and synchrony; (4) why should
   spontaneous activity be irregular; (5) whether the cortical neurons in
   vivo are coincidence detectors or integrators; and (6) the causal
   relationship between theta oscillation, gamma band fluctuation, and P3
   (or P300) ERP responses. Finally, recent experimental results supporting
   the unified view shall be discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland

AB Enterprise information technologies (EITs), which are strategic systems
   seeking to integrate the processes and databases of the entire
   organization and beyond, require a significant investment of money and
   human resources in return for the promise of a global business model and
   its associated far-reaching benefits. Their evaluation/justification
   must be completed with organizational goals and requirements included in
   the decision, or the organization could lose financially and
   competitively. Besides traditional financial models, e.g,, ROI (return
   on investment), that are primarily meant for short-term financial
   justification purposes, there is a paucity of methods for the
   evaluationof the strategic and intangible costs and benefits that EITs
   afford organizations as a whole. This article introduces the use of a
   robust quantitative technique called the analytical hierarchy process
   (AHP) that can integrate a diverse range of (strategic and operational,
   and tangible end intangible) into one model. The approach can be easily
   understood by managers and analysts and has a history of application to
   other types of strategic justification decisions.

AB The objective of this paper is to propose a methodological framework for
   dealing with the complex problem of evaluating Enterprise Resource
   Planning (ERP) projects. The competitive pressure unleashed by the
   process of globalization is driving implementation of ERP projects in
   increasingly large numbers. They occupy a dominant space in today's
   rapidly increasing IT investments. Paradoxically, researchers have noted
   a deteriorating trend of evaluation of these investments. Considering
   huge organizational stakes coupled with a high risk of failure
   associated with the ERP projects, it is imperative that they are
   properly evaluated. Conventional methodology, which reckoned cost
   displacement as the only benefit, has proved inadequate for modern IT
   projects that have decreasing scope for cost displacement and an
   increasing focus on effectiveness objectives. Effectiveness is a
   multi-dimensional attribute and is not amenable to easy quantification.
   ERP projects need multi-dimensional evaluation criteria and a
   methodology that extends into the implementation phase as their profile
   really shapes up in the latter. A solution, in the form of a process
   framework that incorporates participatory learning and decision-making
   processes based on Nominal Group Technique (NGT) and the evaluation
   methodology adopting the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), is
   proposed. A case example is given to illustrate its applicability in
   practice.
