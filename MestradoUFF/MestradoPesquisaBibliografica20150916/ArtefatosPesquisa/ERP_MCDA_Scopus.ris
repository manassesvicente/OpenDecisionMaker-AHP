AB  - Maintaining information in visual working memory is reliably indexed by the contralateral delay activity (CDA) - a sustained modulation of the event-related potential (ERP) with a topographical maximum over posterior scalp regions contralateral to the memorized input. Based on scalp topography, it is hypothesized that the CDA reflects neural activity in the parietal cortex, but the precise cortical origin of underlying electric activity was never determined. Here we combine ERP recordings with magnetoencephalography based source localization to characterize the cortical current sources generating the CDA. Observers performed a cued delayed match to sample task where either the color or the relative position of colored dots had to be maintained in memory. A detailed source-localization analysis of the magnetic activity in the retention interval revealed that the magnetic analog of the CDA (mCDA) is generated by current sources in the parietal cortex. Importantly, we find that the mCDA also receives contribution from current sources in the ventral extrastriate cortex that display a time-course similar to the parietal sources. On the basis of the magnetic responses, forward modeling of ERP data reveals that the ventral sources have non-optimal projections and that these sources are therefore concealed in the ERP by overlapping fields with parietal projections. The present observations indicate that visual working memory maintenance, as indexed by the CDA, involves the parietal cortical regions as well as the ventral extrastriate regions, which code the sensory representation of the memorized content. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, which integrates all of the units within an organization at the information level, plays an important role for a successful enterprise. With the right ERP system, it is easier to provide coordination between the units, eliminate waste and make faster and better decisions. Adopting an ERP system is a significant investment decision for a firm, therefore a great deal of attention should be given to the selection of the right system. Since there are a large number of criteria to consider in selecting an ERP system, the process itself is regarded as a complex multi-criteria decision making problem. In this study, two prevalent multi-criteria decision making techniques, Analytic Network Process (ANP) and Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEE), are used in combination to better address the ERP selection problem. First, ANP is used to determine the weights of all criteria, and then, the obtained weights are used in the PROMETHEE method for optimal ranking of the alternative system choices. To demonstrate the viability of the proposed methodology, an application case is performed on the ERP selection problem for the Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Istanbul, Turkey. The proposed hybrid methodology successfully ranked the alternatives and identified the best ERP system based on the information obtained from a number of SMEs participated in this study. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper aims to develop a multi-criteria decision model for the purpose of ERP vendor selection. To tackle the multi-criteria nature and the presence of both qualitative and quantitative factors, Grey-based model was proposed. Grey theory was utilised as it can effectively solve the multi-criteria decision making problems with small datasets. The major contributions of this work have been summarised as follows: development and implementation of a multi-criteria decision model for ERP vendor selection; group based decision making for comparing among attributes and ERP alternatives and efficient use of the concept of grey numbers to facilitate the solution of the model for SMEs in Qatar. The proposed method will help information system managers to weigh the ERP alternatives before actually implementing them, which will in turn save money and time.

AB  - As a result of emerging computation technologies, information systems are developed to support various processes of enterprises. ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) has been a leading EIS (Enterprise Information Systems) application and companies are allocating resources to such new projects. However, studies report that most of the projects fail or cannot reach the desired outcomes selecting inappropriate software is represented as one of the major sources for project failures. This paper focuses on EIS selection problem which is a multicriteria decision making (MCDM) problem since it contains various and conflicting criteria. In this study, a group decision making approach using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Interval type-2 fuzzy sets is used on a real world ERP selection problem with six criteria and four alternatives. The originality of the study comes from using interval type-2 fuzzy sets in the decision problem. By using interval type-2 fuzzy sets for handling fuzzy group decision-making probems more flexible decisions can be given since interval type-2 fuzzy sets are more suitable to represent uncertainties than type-1 fuzzy set.

AB  - Automation systems for buildings interconnect components and technologies from the information technology industry and the telecommunications industry. In these industries, existing platforms and new platforms (that are designed to make building automation systems work) compete for market acceptance and consequently several platform battles among suppliers for building automation networking are being waged. It is unclear what the outcome of these battles will be and also which factors are important in achieving platform dominance. Taking the fuzziness of decision makers’ judgments into account, a fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making methodology called the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process is applied to investigate the importance of such factors in platform battles for building automation networking. We present the relative importance of the factors for three types of platforms (subsystem platforms, system platforms, and evolved subsystem platforms). The results provide a first indication that the set of important factors differs per type of platform. For example, when focusing on other stakeholders, for subsystem platforms, the previous installed base is of importance; for system platforms, the diversity of the network of stakeholders is essential; and for evolved subsystem platforms, the judiciary is an important factor. © 2014, Systems Engineering Society of China and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Significant information and communication technology has been so effective in the level of enterprises to meet requirement. Today, business environment is more complex, hence many companies need information currency between their different units. To this end, new software systems named enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems which cover commercial goals of macro enterprises have been developed in the industry. In recent years, globalisation and competitiveness of commercial environments have forced companies to invest significant resources in the implementation of ERP. Iranian companies and enterprises have accepted these systems because of their various profits. Success in the implementation of an ERP project is a result of the correct selection of system based on enterprise requirements in the planning phase of the project. In this paper, based on opinions of the project expert team, we determined ERP system criteria and tried to select the best vendor option of ERP system and determine a suitable ERP package for enterprise using multi-criteria decision making technique and combining them with goal programming and fuzzy theory. The case study of this research is a great Iranian enterprise which, as a holding company, covers several different industries. © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems that aimto integrate, synchronize and centralize organizational data are generally regarded as a vital tool for companies to be successful in the rapidly changing global marketplace. Due to its high acquisition-purchasing, installation and implementation-cost and the wide range of offerings, the selection of ERP systems is a strategically important and difficult decision. Since there is a wide range of tangible and intangible criteria to be considered, it is often defined as a multi-criteria decision making problem. To overcome the challenges imposed by the multifaceted nature of the problem, herein a three-stage hybrid methodology is proposed. The process starts with the identification of most prevailing criteria through a series of brainstorming sessions that include people from different organizational units. Then, due to the varying importance of the criteria, a fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process, which handles the vagueness inherent in the decision making process, is used to obtain the relative importance/weights of the criteria. Theseweighted criteria are then used as input to the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution method to rank the decision alternatives. As a real-world illustrative case, the proposed methodology is applied to the ERP selection problem at Turkish Airlines. Because of the collaborative and systematic nature of the methodology, the results obtained from the process were found to be highly satisfactory and trustworthy by the decision makers. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this paper we propose a combined AHP-IBA model for selecting the best SAP consultant for an SAP ERP project. The goal of the SAP Project Manager is to choose the best consultant, the one who is able to implement standard SAP functionalities with quality and on time. When making a decision on the basis of multiple criteria, the traditional Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method does not take into account the fact that attributes may correlate, assuming that there are no dependencies between them. However, the dependencies of the attributes can often be used to model important knowledge for multiple criteria decision analysis. We propose an extension to the traditional AHP method by applying Interpolative realization of Boolean algebra (IBA), using AHP to determine the criteria weights, and IBA to model the logical interactions among criteria. The research conducted on ERP consultant selection suggests that the decision making process is modelled more accurately if logical interactions between attributes are modelled before applying AHP. © 2014 Yugoslav Journal of Operations Research.

AB  - In the recent years ERP systems have received much attention. An enterprise resource planning system (ERP) is the information backbone of a company that integrates and automates all business operations. In spite of considerable changes that the implementation of such systems at all levels of the organization will bring about, lack precision in selecting appropriate ERP systems leads to irreparable damage for the organization. So, it is a critical issue to select the suitable ERP system which meets all the business strategies and the goals of the company. This paper has tried to introduce a method for selecting ERP system by using fuzzy theory and fuzzy multiple criteria decision making. The methodology was applied for Iranian manufacturing company.

AB  - Given that prioritization of programmes is a key concern in Local Agenda 21 processes, the aim of this paper is to explore how the Analytic Network Process (ANP) can provide greater consistency and legitimacy to prioritization of local action plans. Through the analysis of an experience in the municipality of Benetusser in Spain, the study shows how ANP, by modelling reality as a network of multiple and mutual interrelations, embraces complexity and translates it into a set of operational questionnaires that help participants to reflect on their preferences and think deeply on the real implications of programmes for sustainable development. In the case study, citizens, technical staff and politicians of Benetusser carried out the prioritization process by defining a set of criteria and assessing the programmes in an interrelated way. The experience shows that the ANP procedure not only allows prioritization to be dealt with in an organized and systematic way, but also enables reflective thinking on sustainable development and the role of Local Agenda 21 itself. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB  - Any ERP software in the market cannot fully meet the needs and expectations of manufacturing companies, because each company, which looks for implementing ERP system, runs its business with different strategies and goals. Therefore, enterprise resource planning (ERP) software selection is an important and critical decision process. Another aspect of this problem is that multi-disciplinary content reveals the multi-criteria decision making as the appropriate field of study. In this study, by employing TODIM method, which allows the usage of both qualitative and quantitative data, an example, which involves ERP software selection process of a steel forming and hot dip-galvanising firm located in Izmir, Turkey, is provided by using a proposed framework. A new path toward ERP software selection is designed for the decision makers in various industries include manufacturing companies. In order to deal with the complex calculations in the decision making process, the proposed framework is formed as an applicable tool for all decision makers in various industries.

AB  - Cloud computing delivers almost all of its services including software, user's data, system resources, processes and their computation over the Internet. Cloud computing consists of three main classes; Software as a Service, Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as a Service. Using Software as a Service (SaaS), users are able to rent application software and databases which they then install onto their computer in the traditional way. In the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, the system service environment changed so as to allow the application of the SaaS in the cloud computing environment. This change was implemented in order to provide the ERP system service to users in a cheaper, more convenient and efficient form through the Internet as opposed to having to set up their own computer. Recently many SaaS ERP packages are available on the Internet. For this reason, it is very difficult for users to find the SaaS ERP package that would best suit their requirements. The QoS (Quality of Service) model can provide a solution to this problem. However, according to recent research, not only quality attributes' identification for SaaS ERP, but also a process for finding and recommending software in the cloud computing environment, has proved to be lacking. In this paper, we propose a QoS model for SaaS ERP. The proposed QoS model consists of 6 criteria; Functionality, Reliability, Usability, Efficiency, Maintainability and Business. Using this QoS model, we propose a Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) system that finds the best fit for the SaaS ERP in the cloud computing environment and makes recommendations to users in priority order. In order to organize the quality clusters, we organized an expert group and got their opinion to organize the quality clusters using Social Network Group. Social Networks can be used efficiently to get opinion by various types of expert groups. In order to establish the priority, we used pairwise comparisons to calculate the priority weights of each quality attribute while accounting for their interrelation. Finally, using the quality network model and priority weights, this study evaluated three types of SaaS ERPs. Our results show how to find the most suitable SaaS ERPs according to their correlation with the criteria and to recommend a SaaS ERP package which best suits users' needs. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Motivated by information technology evaluation problems identified in a large public sector organization, we propose how evaluation requirements can be supported by a framework combining different models and methods from information systems evaluation theory. The article extends the content, context, process perspectives of organizational change with operations research techniques and demonstrates the approach in practice for an Enterprise Resource Planning evaluation. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - An enterprise resource planning (ERP) system is an information system to plan and integrate all of an enterprise's subsystems including purchase, production, sales and finance. Adopting such a comprehensive framework may result in the great savings in both costs and man hours. This research explores the application of a hybrid multicriteria decision making (MCDM) procedure for the evaluation of various ERP alternatives. The proposed evaluation framework integrates three methodologies: Analytic Network Process (ANP), Choquet integral (CI) and Measuring Attractiveness by a Categorical Based Evaluation Technique (MACBETH). ANP produces the priorities of alternatives with respect to the interdependent evaluation criteria. The conjunctive or disjunctive behaviors between criteria are determined using MACBETH and CI. Numerical application of the proposed methodology is implemented on the decision making problem of a firm that faces with four ERP projects. The final ranking is compared to the one obtained by ignoring the interactions among criteria. The results demonstrate that the ignorance of the interactions may lead to erroneous decisions. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - One of the most important water-resources management strategies for arid lands is managed aquifer recharge (MAR). In establishing a MAR scheme, site selection is the prime prerequisite that can be assisted by geographic information system (GIS) tools. One of the most important uncertainties in the site-selection process using GIS is finite ranges or intervals resulting from data classification. In order to reduce these uncertainties, a novel method has been developed involving the integration of multi-criteria decision making (MCDM), GIS, and a fuzzy inference system (FIS). The Shemil-Ashkara plain in the Hormozgan Province of Iran was selected as the case study; slope, geology, groundwater depth, potential for runoff, land use, and groundwater electrical conductivity have been considered as site-selection factors. By defining fuzzy membership functions for the input layers and the output layer, and by constructing fuzzy rules, a FIS has been developed. Comparison of the results produced by the proposed method and the traditional simple additive weighted (SAW) method shows that the proposed method yields more precise results. In conclusion, fuzzy-set theory can be an effective method to overcome associated uncertainties in classification of geographic information data. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Selecting a proper system of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is amajor challenge for enterprise managers. Heavy expenses of incorrect decisions in selection of ERP systems have made academics and managers consider this phase as highly important. Several research studies proposed different approaches to selecting the ERP and many case studies of organizational experiences have been published. However, there has been less regard for simultaneous use of the findings of academic studies and judgments of industrial experts or organization mangers for making the most appropriate choice. This study proposes ac ombined multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach through which both previous studies and judgments of industrial experts or organization managers would be integrated in order to select the proper ERP system. Having studied the literature comprehensively and conducted interviews with experts and managers, this approach will determine the most important criteria in ERP selection using Shannon entropy technique. Then, based on the judgments obtained from experts and using DEMATEL technique, these criteria will be classified into the two groups of "Cause" and "Effect" and the most appropriate choice will be selected using Fuzzy AHP technique. Finally, a case study is conducted to demonstrate and prove the applicability of the proposed approach. Copyright © 2012, IGI Global.

AB  - This paper applies an analytic hierarchical prediction model based on the Multi-Criteria Decision Making with Incomplete Linguistic Preference Relations (InLinPreRa) to help the organizations become aware of the essential factors affecting the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), as well as identify the actions necessary before implementing ERP. The subjectivity and vagueness in the prediction procedures are dealt with linguistic variables quantified in an interval [-t, t]. Then predicted success/failure values are obtained to enable organizations to decide whether to initiate ERP, inhibit adoption or take remedial actions to increase the success possibility of ERP. Pairwise comparisons are used to determine the priority weights of influential factors, and the possible occurrence ratings of success or failure outcome amongst decision makers. There are not any inconsistency occurred in this procedures because this proposed approach allows every decision expert to choose an explicit criterion or alternative for the without restriction. When there are n criteria in a decision matrix, only n-1 times of pairwise comparisons are taken. This approach not only improves the efficiency of pairwise comparison compared with the traditional AHP, but also avoids the checking the consistency of linguistic preference relation when the decision makers undertake the pairwise comparison processes. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Improperly selected ERP software may have an impact on the time required, and the costs and market share of a company, selecting the best desirable ERP software has been the most critical problem for a long time. On the other hand, selecting ERP software is a multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem, and in the literature, many methods have been introduced to evaluate this kind of problem, which has been widely used in MCDM selection problems. In this paper, an integrated approach of ERP software selection analytic hierarchy process improved by rough sets theory (Rough-AHP) and fuzzy TOPSIS method is proposed to obtain final ranking.

AB  - Benefits of integrated information systems such as ERP (Enterprise resource planning) without suitable infrastructures and successful implementation, is low. The first step For ERP successful implementation as one of the most important management tools and the most effective information systems is choosing it on the base of various quantitative and qualitative criteria. Multi criteria decision- making (MCDM) theory is a suitable method for solving problems that they have sometimes antonymous many factors and parameters. For this purpose, we intend to describe ERP selection criterion and introduce its best sellers perfectly to help managers who want to buy and implement this system. In this research we have tried to use of decision techniques and combine with goal programming to choose an opportune ERP, for TUGA company -the only manufacturer of gas turbines in Iran- a satellite company of Iran power plant projects management organization and present a model for selection process.

AB  - Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software selection is one of the most important decision making issues covering both qualitative and quantitative factors for organizations. Multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) has been found to be a useful approach to analyze these conflicting factors. Qualitative criteria are often accompanied by ambiguities and vagueness. This makes fuzzy logic a more natural approach to this kind of problems. This study presents a beneficial structure to the managers for use in ERP software vendor selection process. In order to evaluate ERP vendors methodologically, a hierarchical framework is also proposed. As a MCDM tool, we used analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and its fuzzy extension to obtain more decisive judgments by prioritizing criteria and assigning weights to the alternatives. The objective of this paper is to select the most appropriate alternative that meets the customer's requirements with respect to cost and quality constraints. In the end of this study, a real-world case study from Turkey is also presented to illustrate efficiency of the methodology and its applicability inpractice. © 2010-IOS Press and the authors.

AB  - BHC Ltd is a family owned SME which specialises in steel fabrication for the construction industry. Due to rapid growth over the past decade the company's current business software has evolved from a collection of semi-integrated individual packages and Excel spreadsheets. To help the company become more efficient during the current financial downturn and to ensure they are capable of future growth, BHC Ltd initiated a project with the University of Strathclyde to select and implement an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution. This paper will provide a case study of BHC's ERP selection process. In particular it will discuss how steel specific business requirements and organisational culture led us to use multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) when making a final software selection. The MCDA process that was followed is further discussed and includes the success that was achieved by using this approach. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.

AB  - Outsourcing can be seen as a strategic way to align technology initiatives and business goals, as a strategy for managing technology operations in today's difficult business environment, and as a way to reduce operating costs. Often, companies begin the process by outsourcing non-core business operations, which may include applications, assets, people and other resources. The outsourcing decision is important since the correct selection can dramatically increase a firm's performance. When companies outsource a significant part of their business and become more dependent on outsourcers, the consequences of poor decision making becomes more severe. Since enterprise resource planning (ERP) is one of the vital systems, if not the one, that integrates all functions including planning, manufacturing, distribution, and accounting into a single system, its outsourcing is a very important multi-attribute decision problem for the firms. In the literature, outsourcing decisions are often based on multi-criteria approaches. In this paper, a fuzzy multi-criteria decision making methodology is suggested for the selection among ERP outsourcing alternatives. The methodology is based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) under fuzziness. It allows decision-makers to express their evaluations in linguistic expressions, crisp or fuzzy numbers. In the application of the proposed methodology, an automotive firm selects the best alternative among three ERP outsourcing firms.

AB  - An enterprise resource planning system (ERP) is the information backbone of a company that integrates and automates all business operations. It is a critical issue to select the suitable ERP system which meets all the business strategies and the goals of the company. This study presents an approach to select a suitable ERP system for textile industry. Textile companies have some difficulties to implement ERP systems such as variant structure of products, production variety and unqualified human resources. At first, the vision and the strategies of the organization are checked by using balanced scorecard. According to the company's vision, strategies and KPIs, we can prepare a request for proposal. Then ERP packages that do not meet the requirements of the company are eliminated. After strategic management phase, the proposed methodology gives advice before ERP selection. The criteria were determined and then compared according to their importance. The rest ERP system solutions were selected to evaluate. An external evaluation team consisting of ERP consultants was assigned to select one of these solutions according to the predetermined criteria. In this study, the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process, a fuzzy extension of the multi-criteria decision-making technique AHP, was used to compare these ERP system solutions. The methodology was applied for a textile manufacturing company. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Previous methods for enterprise software selection generally take into account the attributes that are restricted to some financial factors, such as costs and benefits. However, the literature lacks studies on considering the evaluation of both functional and non-functional suitability of software alternatives versus various requirements. This study presents a new decision support system for combining these two kinds of evaluation to select suitable enterprise software. A hierarchical objective structure that contains both qualitative and quantitative objectives is proposed to evaluate software products systematically. This approach uses a heuristic algorithm, a fuzzy multi-criteria decision making procedure and a multiobjective programming model to make final selection decision. All the phases of presented method are applied in an electronic company's ERP software selection project to validate it with a real application. The satisfactory results are obtained during this project. The company can select the right software to fit its business processes instead of adapting its business processes to fit the software. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In Vendor Selection Process the most important issue is to determine a suitable decision-making method for selecting the best Vendor. Essentially the Vendor Selection Problem (VSP) is a multi-criteria decision making problem involving tangible as well as intangible criterion. Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) can best handle these criterions. But AHP fails to address the issue of interdependencies among and between different levels of attributes. ANP provides a holistic framework for selection of best Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) vendor alternative by using a dynamic multi-directional relationship among the decision attributes. Also ANP equipped with fuzzy logic helps in overcoming the impreciseness or vagueness in the preferences. The method adopted here uses triangular fuzzy numbers for pair-wise comparison of attributes and weights are calculated using entropy concept. A practical example explains our concept and also a comparison is made with crisp ANP. © Medwell Journals, 2008.

AB  - Understanding sustainability requires integrating multiple perspectives and investigative methods to explain multidimensional concepts. However, the traditional approach to research and education is organized along disciplinary lines that tend to exclude awareness of contributions in one field that may inform problems in another. This presents a serious obstacle to advancing an understanding of sustainability, which is focused on the interactions between industrial and ecological systems, rather than examining each system independently. This paper offers a broad description of different perspectives with regard to sustainability including security, reliability, resilience and renewal, and briefly describes the emerging sciences essential to understanding sustainability: ecological economics, industrial ecology, ecosystem health, and sustainable decision making, policy and design. In the latter, the challenges have yet to find an academic locus. Nonetheless, it is in this area that knowledge of sustainability science must be applied and it is consequently most proximate to business leaders, policy makers and designers.

AB  - Nowadays, companies have invested considerable resources in the implementation of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. As a comprehensive software solution, ERP seeks to integrate all departments and functions of a company into a single computer system that can satisfy all departments' information needs. Many companies have wasted millions of dollars as a consequence of failed ERP implementation and adoption. Some of these failures come back to the selection of an ineffective ERP system. This article seeks to propose a method for selecting appropriate ERP systems, to enable firms' decision-makers to achieve an overall consensus by using a decision support process. In addition, since estimating distinct and precise data in the field of Information Systems is hard, a Fuzzy-Data Envelopment Analysis model is used to evaluate the value of each ERP software solution using subjective judgments made by a group of high prestigious IT experts in the petrochemical industry. © 2008, Inderscience Publishers.

AB  - Purpose - This study aims to provide a good insight into the use of analytic network process (ANP), a multi-criteria decision-making methodology in selecting and benchmarking enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. Design/methodology/approach - In this study, ANP model is proposed with an actual case example in selecting the best ERP system as a framework to guide managers. Findings - This model provides firms with a simple, flexible and easy to use approach to evaluate ERP systems efficiently. Findings demonstrate that the ANP model, with minor modifications, can be useful to all firms in their ERP system selection decisions. Research limitations/implications - ANP is a highly complex methodology and requires more numerical calculations in assessing composite priorities than the traditional analytic hierarchy process and hence it increases the effort. Originality/value - This is probably the first time that an attempt has been made to apply the ANP model in ERP system selection decisions. ANP has the ability to be used as a decision-making analysis tool since it incorporates feedback and interdependent relationships among decision criteria and alternatives. In addition, evaluation and selection of ERP system software can be very useful for both academic research and practice. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Software development is an inherently uncertain activity. To deal with the uncertainty and vagueness from humans' subjective perception and experience in decision process, this paper presents an evaluation model based on the fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method for measuring the performance of software development projects. In an MCDM problem, a decision maker (DM) has to choose the best alternative that satisfies the evaluation criteria among a set of candidate solutions. It is generally hard to find an alternative that meets all the criteria simultaneously, so a good compromise solution is preferred. This problem may become more complex when multiple DMs are involved, each having not a common perception on the alternatives. Recently, a compromise ranking method (known as the VIKOR method) has been proposed to identify such compromise solutions, by providing a maximum group utility for the majority and a minimum of an individual regret for the opponent. In its actual setting, the method treats exact values for the assessment of the alternatives, which can be quite restrictive with unquantifiable criteria. This will be true especially if the evaluation is made by means of linguistic terms. For this reason we extend the VIKOR method so as to process such data and to provide a more comprehensive evaluation in a fuzzy environment. To demonstrate the potential of the methodology, the proposed extension is used for measuring the performance of enterprise resource planning (ERP) software products. © 2007 IMACS.

AB  - During the implementations of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, most companies have experienced some problems, one of which is how to determine the best ERP software satisfying their needs and expectations. Because improperly selected ERP software may have an impact on the time required, and the costs and market share of a company, selecting the best desirable ERP software has been the most critical problem for a long time. On the other hand, selecting ERP software is a multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem, and in the literature, many methods have been introduced to evaluate this kind of problem, one of which is the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), which has been widely used in MCDM selection problems. However, in this paper, we use a fuzzy extension of an analytic network process (ANP), a more general form of AHP, which uses uncertain human preferences as input information in the decision-making process, because the AHP cannot accommodate the variety of interactions, dependencies, and feedback between higher- and lower-level elements. Instead of using the classical eigenvector prioritization method in the AHP, only employed in the prioritization stage of ANP, a fuzzy-logic method providing more accuracy on judgements is applied. The resulting fuzzy ANP enhances the potential of the conventional ANP for dealing with imprecise and uncertain human comparison judgements. In short, in this paper, an intelligent approach to ERP software selection through a fuzzy ANP is proposed by taking into consideration quantitative and qualitative elements to evaluate ERP software alternatives.

AB  - The managers spend most of their time to take critical decisions in each level of the organizational hierarchy. Basically, the decision process is to weight diverse alternatives each having the purpose to attain some of the desired objectives and to figure out the best solution in the complete challenging goals set. In today's rapidly changing and highly uncertain environment, the strategic decisions have an extremely complex and fuzzy nature. In the meantime, the enterprises have tendency to appreciate the new product development (NPD) activities so as to deal with the innovation in the new economy and to fulfill the customer demands adequately. The aim of this study is then to improve the accuracy of decision-making in NPD under uncertainty. We first identify the decision points in the NPD process and the uncertainty factors affecting those points. Next, we determine the necessary decision models and techniques to help the decision makers to reduce their risks. Finally, we propose an integrated approach based on fuzzy logic to shape the decisions and illustrate with an application in software development. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Planning a section of a 15-km linear park has generated a delicate situation in the regional county municipality of Portneuf (Quebec, Canada). Faced with discontent among some citizens groups, the county had to define a course of action based on five management designs proposed by the different groups of promoters involved. Since consultations resulted in an impasse, opponents have taken the case before the courts. This paper, based on our doctorate thesis work, attempts to demonstrate how a well-balanced methodological approach that incorporates a planning system of reference, geographic information system (GIS) tools and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) can sometimes help to set apart the preferences of regional players to promote negotiations and simplify the decision-making process.

AB  - The analytic network process (ANP) is presented as a potentially valuable method to support the selection of projects in a research and development (R&D) environment. This paper first discusses the requirements of the R&D project selection problem, which requires the allocation of resources to a set of competing and often disparate project proposals. Among the factors complicating this task is the need to make the decision within the framework of an enterprise's strategic objectives and organizational structure while considering and integrating financial and strategic benefits of each project. The paper discusses the use of the ANP, a general form of Saaty's analytic hierarchy process, as a model to evaluate the value of competing R&D project proposals. A generic ANP model developed by the authors, which includes in its decision levels the actors involved in the decision, the stages of research, categories of metrics, and individual metrics, is presented. The paper concludes with a case study describing the implementation of this model at a small high-tech company, including data based on the actual use of the decision making model.
