AB An enterprise resource planning (ERP) system is an information system to
   plan and integrate all of an enterprise's subsystems including purchase,
   production, sales and finance. Adopting such a comprehensive framework
   may result in the great savings in both costs and man hours. This
   research explores the application of a hybrid multicriteria decision
   making (MCDM) procedure for the evaluation of various ERP alternatives.
   The proposed evaluation framework integrates three methodologies:
   Analytic Network Process (ANP), Choquet integral (Cl) and Measuring
   Attractiveness by a Categorical Based Evaluation Technique (MACBETH).
   ANP produces the priorities of alternatives with respect to the
   interdependent evaluation criteria. The conjunctive or disjunctive
   behaviors between criteria are determined using MACBETH and Cl.
   Numerical application of the proposed methodology is implemented on the
   decision making problem of a firm that faces with four ERP projects. The
   final ranking is compared to the one obtained by ignoring the
   interactions among criteria. The results demonstrate that the ignorance
   of the interactions may lead to erroneous decisions. (C) 2012 Elsevier
