AB Purpose - This paper aims to revisit the adoption reasons of enterprise
   systems (ES) and supply chain management systems (SCMS) and to explore
   the new dimensions of sustainability required to be added in the whole
   process of adoption of these systems. Moreover, it aims to explore the
   benefits of ES to organizations and to relate these benefits to the ES
   adoption in future sustainable city settings. Future cities will have
   micro-industries requiring dynamic interactions and will be dependent on
   efficient supply chains. The recent developments in information and
   communications technology (ICT) such as cloud computing through its
   dynamic, on-demand and service-based delivery are making it possible to
   achieve those goals for supply chains. The ES in general and more
   specifically SCMS have integrated organizations into one seamless mesh.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents a framework for
   adoption of sustainable ES in a smart city setting. The framework,
   firstly, is presented at a macro-level, particularly incorporating the
   relative significance of motivational factors for sustainable ES
   adoption. Subsequently, The authors study the benefits of ES as
   perceived by large and small and medium enterprise (SME) organizations
   using 100 case studies and discuss how these benefits can be realized
   for smart cities by projecting the ES benefits onto the proposed
   framework. The benefits are estimated with the Shang and Seddon's (2002)
   framework.
   Findings - The adoption of ES initiated with environmental factors and
   mediated with business and technical factors will bring benefits in all
   the dimensions of triple bottom line in addition to the firm's
   performance. ES will have pivotal role in future smart city settings and
   will be able to offer social, environmental and economic sustainability
   in addition to traditional organizational performance indicators.
   Originality/value - The proposed framework for ES adoption will bring ES
   packages (particularly, the required relative significance of adoption
   reasons) into the perspective of sustainable development. Moreover, the
   study of its benefits in relation to the proposed sustainable ES
   adoption framework presented in this paper will help in motivating
   organizations to incorporate social, economic and environmental
   sustainability into their core business objectives.

   Rays (UHECR). TARA is co-located with the Telescope Array, the largest
   "conventional" cosmic ray detector in the Northern Hemisphere, in
   radio-quiet Western Utah. TARA employs an 8 MW Effective Radiated Power
   (ERP) VHF transmitter and smart receiver system based on a 250 MS/s data
   acquisition system in an effort to detect the scatter of sounding
   radiation by UHECR-induced atmospheric ionization. TARA seeks to
   demonstrate bi-static radar as a useful new remote sensing technique for

AB There are a variety of economic and ecological benefits to increased
   resource efficiency. Social, institutional and technical innovations can
   all contribute towards efficiency increases. Companies face different
   hurdles in fostering such innovation. Small and medium-sized companies
   are subject to specific constraints that may prevent them from
   benefiting from innovation-induced resource efficiency improvements.
   Qualitative interviews were conducted among German small and
   medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and intermediaries to identify barriers
   for resource efficiency innovations and to elaborate a policy mix at the
   federal level that could help SMEs to overcome these. We found five
   major barriers to resource efficiency innovations in German SMEs,
   comprising deficits in innovation culture, inter-firm cooperation along
   the value chain, finance, awareness and take-up of government funds. We
   propose a distinct policy mix as a response to this situation. The
   policy mix comprises the interlocking and synergistic elements of
   government funding schemes, innovation agents and innovation
   laboratories. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP

AB The present study examined the transfer of higher-order cognitive
   strategy training to inhibitory control. Middle school students enrolled
   in a comprehension- and reasoning-focused cognitive strategy training
   program and passive controls participated. The training program taught
   students a set of steps for inferring essential gist or themes from
   materials. Both before and after training or a comparable duration in
   the case of the passive controls, participants completed a semantically
   cued Go/No-Go task that was designed to assess the effects of depth of
   semantic processing on response inhibition and components of
   event-related potentials (ERP) related to response inhibition. Depth of
   semantic processing was manipulated by varying the level of semantic
   categorization required for response selection and inhibition. The
   SMART-trained group showed inhibitory control gains and changes in
   fronto-central P3 ERP amplitudes on inhibition trials; whereas, the
   control group did not. The results provide evidence of the transfer of
   higher-order cognitive strategy training to inhibitory control and
   modulation of ERPs associated with semantically cued inhibitory control.
   The findings are discussed in terms of implications for cognitive
   strategy training, models of cognitive abilities, and education.

   However, existing mechanical or electro-magnetic diligence/indolence
   managementsystems have the problems that the systems are often incorrect
   or require much cost to build them. In this paper, wedesign and
   implement the diligence/indolence management system using a smart device
   of an employee. To measurethe data of the diligence/indolence, the
   implemented system acquires the location data of the employee using the
   MACaddresses of both a smart device and access points of the WiFi and
   transfers the data of punching-in/out based on theacquired location to a
   server. The benefit of the proposed system is that it is easy for small
   business to use the proposedD/I management system with low cost because
   the system exploits smart devices and WiFi access points

AB In recent years, there has been growing interest in the use of TiNi
   shape memory alloys (SMAs) as functional/smart materials for a variety
   of applications. In this study, (Ti51Ni49-xRex) shape memory alloy has
   been modified by adding various amounts of rhenium (Re) (x = 0, 0.1 and
   0.3 %) at the expense of Ni. As a first step towards studying the effect
   of Re (as an alloying element) on the microstructure, phase
   transformation, mechanical properties and uniform and pitting corrosion
   processes of the three tested (Ti51Ni49-xRex) shape memory alloys, we
   have reported the results of cyclic polarization measurements on
   passivity breakdown and initiation and propagation of pits on the
   surfaces of the three tested alloys in aerated neutral 0.05 M KBr
   solution. The potentiodynamic anodic polarization curves of the three
   tested alloys exhibited no active dissolution region due to spontaneous
   passivation. The passive region is followed by pitting corrosion as a
   result of breakdown of the passive film induced by Br- anions. Cyclic
   polarization measurements allow the pitting potential (E-pit) and the
   repassivation potential ((Erp)) to be determined. E-pit increased with
   increase in Re content in the tested samples. Pitting morphology studies
   showed that the severity of pitting attack suppressed upon alloying
   Ti51Ni49 shape memory alloy with Re. These findings demonstrated that
   the presence of Re enhanced the pitting corrosion resistance of the
   tested alloys to an extent depending on the Re content. ICP-AES
   (inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry) was also
   employed as an independent method of chemical analysis to confirm
   results obtained from cyclic polarizations measurements.

AB Information technology (IT) involve a wide set of risks. Enterprise
   information systems are a major developing form of information
   technology involving their own set of risks, thus creating potential
   blind spots. This paper describes risk management issues involved in
   enterprise resource planning systems (ERP) which have high impact on
   organizations due to their high cost, and their pervasive impact on
   organizational operations. Alternative means of acquiring ERP systems,
   to include outsourcing to application service providers (ASPs) are
   available. But outsourcing ERP involves many risks that are often
   overlooked. After identification of typical risks involved with
   representative alternative forms of ERP, multiple criteria analysis is
   proposed as a useful tool for tradeoff analysis in this selection
   decision. SMART is compared with popular approaches such as DEA and
   PCA-based DEA. A demonstration of how multiple criteria analysis can be
   applied in the international ERP alternative selection decision is given
   by including outsourcing to China and South Korea.

AB Radio frequency identification (RFID) technology has long been known for
   its ability to uniquely identify objects. Recent years have witnessed a
   significant increase in storage capacity on the tag, which is giving
   rise to a new set of application scenarios. As the tag itself can carry
   relevant context information, processes can be managed locally rather
   than relying on a centralised system infrastructure. This in turn
   results in a massive interoperability challenge. We propose to solve
   this problem by combining RFID technology with ontologies to create
   smart objects in the context of manufacturing process control. The idea
   is to store information originating from an SAP ERP system using the PSL
   Ontology (ISO 18629) for representing processes and time directly on the
   RFID tags. As an item flows through a manufacturing process, information
   about the item can be stored on its tag. This information, along with
   the PSL axioms, can be used to make inferences about the manufacturing
   process and the item in particular. In this paper, we discuss our
   formalisation of an ontology for the SAP data model and show an example
   of translating data from an SAP ERP system into PSL axioms, and
   answering queries about a manufacturing process.

AB With the advent of affordable antiretroviral treatment (ART), flow
   cytometry has ventured out of the exclusive realms of First World
   research to the resource-strapped clinical environment of developing
   countries (DCs). Flow cytometric instrumentation for ART has become more
   cost-efficient, thanks to simplified, yet accurate protocols and smart
   technologies. These positive developments have, however, not taken shape
   without problems, as health care in DCs remains weak due to chronic
   underfunding of their primary health systems. In addition, the
   multiplicity of donors has created parallel infrastructures that are
   difficult to manage and may undermine the responsibilities of public
   services. Hence, there is a prevailing lack of attention to maintenance,
   support, and human resource development. Not uncommonly, the procurement
   of high-value equipment is guided by nontechnical interests with mixed
   results. As conventional service contracts are unpopular, the
   sustainability of equipment is under serious threat after warranty
   periods, with environmental factors such as dust and unreliable power
   supplies being well-known culprits. Reagent supplies and servicing
   constitute further challenges, where a combination of short reagent
   shelf life, cold-box shipping, huge distances across poor
   infrastructures, rigid accounting procedures, and erratic customs
   requirements cause significant delays and extra costs. Although
   excellent, highly trained or trainable local staff is available, it is
   frequently diverted by brain drain from the government sector to
   privately funded hospitals, research facilities, and overseas postings.
   Despite these challenges, corporate service management has commonly
   remained loyal to its roots in the developed world. A number of
   propositions address the current situation: "Reagent-rental" agreements
   represent an attractive alternative to service contracts, while smart
   instrument design has started to make inroads into more robust device
   concepts. To avoid logistical bottlenecks, reagents call for
   lyophilization and increased heat stability. Newly designed remote
   diagnostic tools are expected to save costs on service visits.
   Furthermore, web-based customer-relationship management and enterprise
   resource planning software is expected to ease the existing complex
   communication- and logistics issues. In addition, a public-private
   partnership is proposed that involves government, manufacturers, and
   local distributors with field application specialists. The latter
   operate crossbrand as independent subcontractors to manufacturers under
   a nationally endorsed cost-capping and quality assurance agreement to
   service all cytometric devices common in the region. These locally run
   networks may serve as "templates" for improved laboratory services in
   general, in collaboration with CD4 counting, haematology and infectious
   disease diagnostics. (C) 2008 Clinical Cytometry Society.

AB Purpose - Presents a microcomputer-based finite scheduling approach to
   effective planning and execution of make-to-order production. Going
   beyond the traditional application of scheduling algorithms to
   prioritize jobs through work centers, the finite scheduling approach can
   be used to establish "smart" promise dates, manage the jobs through the
   work centers and enable supervisors to meet these due dates in the
   dynamic MTO environment.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using data from an operational jobshop and
   a simulation-based finite scheduling algorithm linked to pre- and
   post-processing capabilities developed in Access, this research provides
   specific examples of establishing smart due dates and managing resources
   to meet those dates. We provide some what-ifs in order to more fully
   explore the benefits of a finite scheduling system.
   Findings - Through use of actual jobshop data, the paper demonstrates
   that finite scheduling can be effectively performed on standard
   computing equipment. It also provides an understanding of finite
   scheduling and demonstrates that such a system can be of significant
   value in a MTO environment
   Research limitations/implications - Future research could review/compare
   various ERP packages and their scheduling components to provide guidance
   on selection and implementation.
   Practical implications - The paper clearly indicates that managers, even
   of smaller companies, should be considering the use of finite
   scheduling.
   Originality/value - The paper provides a new approach to finite
   scheduling using a combination of simulation and Microsoft Access on a
   personal computer. Additionally, it provides a very useful presentation
   for practitioners who want an understanding of finite scheduling and why
   they need to implement it.
