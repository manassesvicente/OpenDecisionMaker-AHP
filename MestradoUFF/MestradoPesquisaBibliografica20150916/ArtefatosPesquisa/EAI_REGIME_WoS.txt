AB Managing Mississippi's forest lands to produce both quality wildlife
   habitat as well as merchantable timber can be a daunting challenge for
   forest managers and a source of great concern for the public. In some
   cases, producing both the quantity and quality of habitat needed and the
   timber desired is all but impossible. In other cases, a delicate balance
   that achieves both objectives can be struck. The objective of this study
   was to quantitatively estimate monetary gains and losses and changes in
   timber inventories relative to the timber growing stock when producing
   more or less habitat for the red-cockaded woodpecker (RCW) (Picoides
   borealis). USDA Forest Service vegetation data, habitat ratings, and
   economic variables were compiled for those regions of Mississippi best
   suited for RCWs. Data was then analyzed with Spectrum, the USDA Forest
   Service-based forest planning software. Models maximizing such
   objectives as net present value (NPV) alone as well as five different
   levels of RCW habitat quality over a 50-year rotation were developed.
   Revenue foregone, acres and volumes harvested, land expectation value
   (LEV), and equivalent annual income (EAI) were compared for all
   objectives for the South Central Hills and Pine Belt regions of
   Mississippi (1,036,208 acres) for three ownership types. As expected,
   when maximizing for any quality level of RCW habitat, revenue forgone
   was higher ($0.11-$49/acre/year) than for NPV alone. Volume harvested
   for high-quality habitat ranged from 152,296 to 10,237,649 cunits, while
   harvests from low-quality habitat ranged from 637,491 to 116,357,673
   cunits. Lower levels of habitat management allowed for an increased
   emphasis on timber harvesting. In general, we determined that increases
   in habitat quality resulted in lower timber harvest levels and increased
   revenue forgone than regimes maximizing NPVs. While this result may be
   expected, of greater importance are the relative differences between
   regimes and the ability to use these values for policy decisions. (C)
