AB We integrated five indicator indices viz., wildlife. distribution index
   (WDI), ecological value index (EVI), ecotourism attractivity index
   (EAI), environmental resiliency index (ERI), ecotourism diversity index
   (EDI) to identify and prioritize the potential ecotourism sites in West
   District of Sikkim state in India. The primary variables used for
   generating various indices were landform, elevation, land use/forest
   cover, vegetation diversity, density and endemism, wildlife (mainly
   birds and butterflies), tourism attraction features and the
   infrastructure facilities. Data and information from remote sensing and
   other sources were used. The analytical hierarchical process and
   geographic information system were effectively used for identification
   of the potential ecotourism sites (PES).
