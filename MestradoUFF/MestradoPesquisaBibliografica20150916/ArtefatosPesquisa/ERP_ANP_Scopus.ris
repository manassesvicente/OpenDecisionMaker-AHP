AB  - Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, which integrates all of the units within an organization at the information level, plays an important role for a successful enterprise. With the right ERP system, it is easier to provide coordination between the units, eliminate waste and make faster and better decisions. Adopting an ERP system is a significant investment decision for a firm, therefore a great deal of attention should be given to the selection of the right system. Since there are a large number of criteria to consider in selecting an ERP system, the process itself is regarded as a complex multi-criteria decision making problem. In this study, two prevalent multi-criteria decision making techniques, Analytic Network Process (ANP) and Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEE), are used in combination to better address the ERP selection problem. First, ANP is used to determine the weights of all criteria, and then, the obtained weights are used in the PROMETHEE method for optimal ranking of the alternative system choices. To demonstrate the viability of the proposed methodology, an application case is performed on the ERP selection problem for the Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Istanbul, Turkey. The proposed hybrid methodology successfully ranked the alternatives and identified the best ERP system based on the information obtained from a number of SMEs participated in this study. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this paper was to evaluate the risk level for both intra-organizational cultures and for different industries in implementing an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. This study adopts the Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (FANP) method to assess ERP implementation risks, which were categorized into four dimensions: management and execution, software system, users, and technology planning. An empirical survey was conducted that utilized the collected survey data of 20 ERP experts in Taiwan to assess, rank, and improve the critical risks of ERP implementation via the FANP method. Based on the results of the FANP method, a follow-up survey of ERP end-users in different departments of three industries was conducted to assess how intra-organizational cultures and cross-industries affect users' perceived risks a real world scenario. Our research results demonstrated that "lack of management support and assistance" is vital risk for a successful ERP implementation. Top management support and involvement are crucial and essential factors to the success of a firm's ERP implementation. "Ineffective communication with users" was found to be the second highest risk factor. The benefits of using the FANP method for evaluating the risk factors come from the clear priority weights between alternatives. Finally, this study provides suggestions to help enterprises decrease ERP risks, and enhance the chances of success of ERP implementations among intra-organizational cultures and across-industries. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - As traditional concept in management, decision support had a remarkable role in competitiveness or survival of organisations and following, as modern impression, nowadays business intelligence (BI) has various applications in achieving desirable decision supports. Consequently, assessing BI competencies of enterprise systems can enable decision support in firms. This paper presents a practical framework for assessing the business intelligence capabilities of enterprise systems based on a set of novel factors and utilising fuzzy analytic network process (FANP). Through this, the construct of BI competency is decomposed into three main competency parts including 'managerial', 'technical' and 'system enabler' sub-goals, five main factors and 26 criteria. Using this framework, the BI competency level of enterprise systems can be determined which can help the decision makers to selec the enterprise system that best suits organisations' intelligence decision support needs. In order to validate the proposed model, it is applied to a real Iranian international offshore engineering and construction company in the oil industry to select and acquire ERP system. This research provides a complete frame (factors, criteria and procedures) for firms to assess their proposed software and systems in the field of BI competencies and functions.

AB  - Given that prioritization of programmes is a key concern in Local Agenda 21 processes, the aim of this paper is to explore how the Analytic Network Process (ANP) can provide greater consistency and legitimacy to prioritization of local action plans. Through the analysis of an experience in the municipality of Benetusser in Spain, the study shows how ANP, by modelling reality as a network of multiple and mutual interrelations, embraces complexity and translates it into a set of operational questionnaires that help participants to reflect on their preferences and think deeply on the real implications of programmes for sustainable development. In the case study, citizens, technical staff and politicians of Benetusser carried out the prioritization process by defining a set of criteria and assessing the programmes in an interrelated way. The experience shows that the ANP procedure not only allows prioritization to be dealt with in an organized and systematic way, but also enables reflective thinking on sustainable development and the role of Local Agenda 21 itself. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB  - To meet the changes of internal and external environment, Enterprise Resources Planning (ERP) system needs to have a good flexibility. Flexibility is an indispensable request and is also a way that must be taken during the establishment process of ERP. Flexibility measurement is an important item for the implementation of ERP flexibility. According to the characteristics of ERP system, an index system for flexibility measurement of ERP system is presented with the interdependence and feedback relationships among criteria and/or indices being taken into account. Due to the vagueness and uncertainty information during the process of flexibility measurement, triangular fuzzy numbers are used to indicate the preference opinions of experts and decision makers. A flexibility measurement model of ERP system based on fuzzy analytic network process (FANP) is proposed. The local weights of criteria and indices are derived by fuzzy preference programming (FPP) method. An unweighted supermatrix based on the network structure of index system is developed, and the limit supermatrix is generated. The flexibility level of ERP system can be measured by the weights and scores of ERP. Finally, a case is given by the proposed method. © 2013 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.

AB  - Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is a product that enables organizations achieving their competitive advantage. However, the failures of ERP implementation are still considered quite high. This research was conducted to formulate the framework of self-assessment of open source ERP implementation readiness, which focused on the ERP pre-implementation aspects. The proposed ERP implementation readiness assessment framework was developed using the Fuzzy-based ANP (Fuzzy ANP), where the examined readiness factors are grouped into three categories, namely project management, organizational, and change management readiness. In order to see the application of the framework, we conducted a case study on an SME engaged in software development. We did focus group discussion with Chief Technology Officer, Chief Strategy Officer and Project Manager. The results showed that the company is not ready to implement open source ERP. Although the company is strong in the human resources aspect, they are still weak in other aspects so that they need some strategies to improve their level of readiness before implementing open source ERP. © 2013 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.

AB  - Considerable resources are needed when implementing the ERP project, so it is necessary to evaluate its performance. Firstly, the evaluation index system of implementation performance of the ERP project was built, and an Analytic Network Process (ANP) which can fully take the relationship between evaluation indexes into account was employed to determine the index weight. Secondly, an improved matter-element extension model, which can overcome the limitations and inadequacies of traditional matter-element extension model when performing the comprehensive evaluation, was proposed to evaluate the implementation performance of the ERP project. Finally, taking an enterprise's ERP project as an example, a comprehensive evaluation was done, and the empirical analysis result shows that this proposed hybrid evaluation model is feasible and practical. © 2013 Zhao Hui-ru and Li Na-na.

AB  - The research examined different types of risk through interviews with experts. The risks studied include business interruption risk, process interdependency risk and system security risk. The decision making trial and evaluation laboratory is used to find the relationship among risks and combined with the analytic network process to select the optimal measures for reducing risks. The results indicate that information technology (IT) consultants prefer the Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP). They usually use the remote replication or High Availability (HA) to protect data. IT personnel believe that all of the IT risk controls are important. Auditors indicate that data access control is very important because users have to execute data access every day. Users of IT express a preference towards data input/output control as the most important control. The results achieved from all experts indicate that the most important controls overall are data input/output control, data access control and so on. Managers need to consider these risks to avoid any potential problems. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Implementing an enterprise resource planning system is a sophisticated, lengthy, and costly process which tends to face serious failure. Thus, it is essential to perform a success assessment at the post-implementation stage of an ERP project to evaluate how much the system has succeeded in achieving its predetermined objectives. This paper proposes a practical framework for assessing a firm's ERP post-implementation success utilising current models through a fuzzy analytic network process. The construct of ERP success is broken down into three main parts, including managerial success, organisational success, and individual success. Using this framework, the firm's ERP system success can be determined and the required improvement projects can be proposed to promote the success level. The proposed framework has been applied to a real international company, in the field of manufacturing and supplying turbines, to measure the firm's ERP postimplementation success. Finally, the advantages of the model are illustrated. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) can coordinate the different functions of enterprises and improve the information flows. As for the actual production situation, the ERP may not receive and record the information of equipments in detail, and the manufacturing execution system (MES) may not collect various kind of information between different business functions. Therefore, the ERP integrating the MES may help the enterprise to control the business operation smoothly. This research applied the decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and analytic network process (ANP) method for the MES module into ERP system selection. The research results show that the DEMATEL may clarify the relationship and the ANP can compute the weights of criteria of the ERP and MES modules. The research also indicated that there is a high demand in integrating the sales and distribution module (SDM) of ERP into the material management system (MMS) of MES, which may improve the effectiveness of MES.

AB  - An enterprise resource planning (ERP) system is an information system to plan and integrate all of an enterprise's subsystems including purchase, production, sales and finance. Adopting such a comprehensive framework may result in the great savings in both costs and man hours. This research explores the application of a hybrid multicriteria decision making (MCDM) procedure for the evaluation of various ERP alternatives. The proposed evaluation framework integrates three methodologies: Analytic Network Process (ANP), Choquet integral (CI) and Measuring Attractiveness by a Categorical Based Evaluation Technique (MACBETH). ANP produces the priorities of alternatives with respect to the interdependent evaluation criteria. The conjunctive or disjunctive behaviors between criteria are determined using MACBETH and CI. Numerical application of the proposed methodology is implemented on the decision making problem of a firm that faces with four ERP projects. The final ranking is compared to the one obtained by ignoring the interactions among criteria. The results demonstrate that the ignorance of the interactions may lead to erroneous decisions. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents a modified model for selecting public relations (PR) agencies, considering the interdependencies among decision criteria. First, the proposed model adopts the "Nominal Group Technique (NGT)" to identify suitable evaluation criteria for selecting PR agencies. Next, the model uses the "Analytic Network Process (ANP)" to determine the relative weights of the criteria, then ranks the alternatives and select the optimum PR agency in the high-tech industry. Furthermore, this study uses the example of a renowned high-tech communications manufacturer in Taiwan to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in PR agencies selection. Research results find the six sub-criteria that high-tech enterprises emphasize most include IMC planning, resource integration ability, media exposure, creative campaign design, creative media planning and enterprise and product image promotion. The modified model helps high-tech enterprises to effectively select PR firms, making it highly applicable in academia and commerce.

AB  - In today's world of competition, effective and on time information and efficient decisions are indispensable aspects of the management. Enterprise Resource Planning systems are information systems that ensure an effective and efficient management by providing cooperative data flow, handling and planning all process. ERP projects represent a major investment but their failure rates are very high. They are risky projects. Six main risk factors considered in this study are: Executive risks, Organizational risks, Project management risks, Technical risks, Decision making risks, Functional risks. Having "evaluation of the failure risk of a SAP/R3 implementation project" as the main objective, possible inter and inner relationships/dependencies between the main factors are considered and an Analytic Network Process approach is proposed to the model. Decision makers usually are unable to be explicit about their preferences due to the fuzzy nature of the comparison process. So, expert judgments are matched with fuzzy numbers, in this study. © 2011 Old City Publishing, Inc.

AB  - Asus Tech. is the largest motherboard manufacturer in Taiwan. Hundreds of suppliers cooperate with the company in business. So that supplier selection is the most important function of a purchasing department in the enterprise. An enterprise resource planning (ERP) system in the process of supplier selection may result in the great savings in both costs and man hours. In the concept of push and pull, an ERP system acts as an efficient tool in the resource integration and profit creation for a company. Through ERP, a decision manager can clearly realize the strength and weakness of the purchasing operation. To establish a real-time purchasing environment, a methodology of analytic network process (ANP), technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and linear programming (LP) are effectively applied in the supplier selection process. ANP and TOPSIS are used to calculate the weight and give suppliers a ranking; LP effectively allocates order quantity to each vendor. As to the result, four PC board suppliers are given orders for 1200, 727, 1000 and 73 pieces. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Previous studies report unusually high failure in enterprise resource planning (ERP) projects. Thus, it is necessary to perform an assessment at the initial stage of an ERP implementation program to identify weaknesses or problems which may lead to project failure. No definite practical solution could be found for these kinds of problems in the literature. In this paper, a new look at the determinants of a firm's readiness to implement an ERP project is presented and using fuzzy analytic network process a practical framework is developed. The firm's current conditions regarding ERP project can be determined and necessary changes prior to implementation of ERP system can be specified. The readiness for ERP implementation is decomposed into project management, organizational, and change management areas and the assessment factors are identified after comprehensive study of critical success factors on ERP implementation. The proposed framework is applied to a real case and the advantages are illustrated. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - An enterprise resource planning (ERP) software selection is known to be multi attribute decision making (MADM) problem. This problem has been modeled according with analytic network process (ANP) method due to fact that it considers criteria and sub criteria relations and interrelations in selecting the software. Opinions of many experts are obtained while building ANP model for the selection ERP then opinions are reduced to one single value by methods like geometric means so as to get desired results. To use ANP model for the selection of ERP for a new organization, a new group of expert's opinions are needed. In this case the same problem will be in counter. In the proposed model, when ANP and ANN models are setup, an ERP software selection can be made easily by the opinions of one single expert. In that case calculation of geometric mean of answers that obtained from many experts will be unnecessary. Additionally the effect of subjective opinion of one single decision maker will be avoided. In terms of difficulty, ANP has some difficulties due to eigenvalue and their limit value calculation. An ANN model has been designed and trained with using ANP results in order to calculate ERP software priority. The artificial neural network (ANN) model is trained by results obtained from ANP. It seems that there is no any major difficulty in order to predict software priorities with trained ANN model. By this results ANN model has been come suitable for using in the selection of ERP for another new decision. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The paper addresses the alignment between business processes and information technology in enterprise resource planning (ERP) implementation. More specifically, we concentrate on one of the key decisions at the tactical alignment level: the decision on the implementation sequence of the ERP modules. Since the module sequencing problem involves a myriad of organizational and technical issues, connected to each other in networked manner, the analytic network process (ANP) methodology is applied. As a result of the study, we present first a general level conceptual framework to sequence ERP module implementations and expand the model to a more detailed level in a case study. The priorities for the implementation sequence of the ERP modules are determined in the case study. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Abandoning a project is difficult as it engages an enormous psychological load for project managers and team members and increases personal and professional insecurities. Organisations not only delay this kind of decisions, but also escalate their commitment into a failing project. Terminating a failing project with least of problems, releasing valuable resources and investing in higher potential projects are crucial for organisation's prosperity. The aim of this study is to support the decision making when project termination is of question, help project managers and executives understand the problem context and revise their belief about terminating projects. The paper proposes a framework, based on the analytic network process. The study reveals the criteria that have to be taken into consideration in project termination decisions and provides a structured approach in order to help managers make decisions. The paper includes a case study of a troubled ERP implementation project in a SME. Copyright © 2009, Inderscience Publishers.

AB  - In Vendor Selection Process the most important issue is to determine a suitable decision-making method for selecting the best Vendor. Essentially the Vendor Selection Problem (VSP) is a multi-criteria decision making problem involving tangible as well as intangible criterion. Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) can best handle these criterions. But AHP fails to address the issue of interdependencies among and between different levels of attributes. ANP provides a holistic framework for selection of best Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) vendor alternative by using a dynamic multi-directional relationship among the decision attributes. Also ANP equipped with fuzzy logic helps in overcoming the impreciseness or vagueness in the preferences. The method adopted here uses triangular fuzzy numbers for pair-wise comparison of attributes and weights are calculated using entropy concept. A practical example explains our concept and also a comparison is made with crisp ANP. © Medwell Journals, 2008.

AB  - Enterprise information systems, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP), manufacturing executive systems (MES), customer relation management (CRM) and so on, are grasping increasing attention, due to their ability to improve production and business performance, and raise competitive advantage for enterprises. However, what these enterprise information systems bring about are not only benefits and potential opportunities, but also costs and potential risks. So a comprehensive and systematic assessment is necessary for executives to select the most suitable project from many alternatives. This paper first proposes a decision method for project selection. Analytic network process (ANP) is used to make the decision with regard to benefits (B), opportunities (O), costs (C) and risks (R). Then this decision method is examined by a case study of MES project selection in a Chinese undershirt manufacturer. Although this case is about enterprise information system project selection, it contributes to the study of ANP application in project selection in broader areas besides enterprise information system project. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA.

AB  - Purpose - This study aims to provide a good insight into the use of analytic network process (ANP), a multi-criteria decision-making methodology in selecting and benchmarking enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. Design/methodology/approach - In this study, ANP model is proposed with an actual case example in selecting the best ERP system as a framework to guide managers. Findings - This model provides firms with a simple, flexible and easy to use approach to evaluate ERP systems efficiently. Findings demonstrate that the ANP model, with minor modifications, can be useful to all firms in their ERP system selection decisions. Research limitations/implications - ANP is a highly complex methodology and requires more numerical calculations in assessing composite priorities than the traditional analytic hierarchy process and hence it increases the effort. Originality/value - This is probably the first time that an attempt has been made to apply the ANP model in ERP system selection decisions. ANP has the ability to be used as a decision-making analysis tool since it incorporates feedback and interdependent relationships among decision criteria and alternatives. In addition, evaluation and selection of ERP system software can be very useful for both academic research and practice. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Objectives: Atrial electrical remodeling is considered to play an important role in the appearance of atrial fibrillation. The effect of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) on atrial electrical remodeling was evaluated in a canine atrial stimulation model. Methods: In 15 beagle dogs, electrodes for pacing and recording were fixed on the atrial surface. In 10/15 dogs, rapid atrial stimulation (400 bpm) was performed for 7 h at the right atrial appendage (RAA) and the remaining 5 were used as the sham without rapid pacing. In 5/10 dogs with rapid pacing, human atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) was infused (1.0 μg/kg/min). The effective refractory period (ERP) and the monophasic action potential duration (MAP) were evaluated at 0, 3, and 7 h after rapid pacing. The expression levels of mRNAs of ion channels or transporters were evaluated from the atrial samples of sham and after a 7 hour pacing. Results: In the control group with rapid pacing (n = 5), the atrial ERP and MAP duration were shortened at all atrial sites, e.g., ERP from 148 ±14 ms to 109 ± 8 ms at RAA, P = 0.006. In contrast in the ANP group, neither the ERP nor MAP duration showed a significant shortening and the effect of ANP on hemodynamic parameter was relatively small. Expression levels of the mRNA were not significantly different between the control and ANP groups. Conclusions: Administration of ANP prevented the shortening of the ERP and MAP duration in the rapid atrial stimulation model. The effect of ANP on atrial electrical remodeling was considered to be due to its direct action on the myocardium. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - During the implementations of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, most companies have experienced some problems, one of which is how to determine the best ERP software satisfying their needs and expectations. Because improperly selected ERP software may have an impact on the time required, and the costs and market share of a company, selecting the best desirable ERP software has been the most critical problem for a long time. On the other hand, selecting ERP software is a multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem, and in the literature, many methods have been introduced to evaluate this kind of problem, one of which is the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), which has been widely used in MCDM selection problems. However, in this paper, we use a fuzzy extension of an analytic network process (ANP), a more general form of AHP, which uses uncertain human preferences as input information in the decision-making process, because the AHP cannot accommodate the variety of interactions, dependencies, and feedback between higher- and lower-level elements. Instead of using the classical eigenvector prioritization method in the AHP, only employed in the prioritization stage of ANP, a fuzzy-logic method providing more accuracy on judgements is applied. The resulting fuzzy ANP enhances the potential of the conventional ANP for dealing with imprecise and uncertain human comparison judgements. In short, in this paper, an intelligent approach to ERP software selection through a fuzzy ANP is proposed by taking into consideration quantitative and qualitative elements to evaluate ERP software alternatives.

AB  - Atrial Electrophysiological Effects of ANP Introduction: Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) may alter electrophysiological properties of the heart and possibly have a role in arrhythmogenesis. However, previous studies have yielded conflicting results and have not fully considered whether ANP's cardiac electrophysiological effects are mediated via direct actions and/or indirectly via the autonomic nervous system. This study's aim was to establish whether ANP infused at pathophysiological and pharmacological doses has significant in vivo cardiac electrophysiological effects and to determine whether these effects are directly or autonomically mediated. Methods and Results: Electrophysiologic and hemodynamic effects of ANP infusion (human ANP at 15-600 ng/kg per minute) were examined in chloralose-anesthetized dogs under conditions of varying autonomic blockade. In autonomically intact dogs (n = 12), low-dose ANP (15 ng/kg per minute) shortened atrial effective refractory period (ERP) (P < 0.001) and monophasic action potential duration (MAPD90) (P < 0.05) at 600, 500, and 400 msec atrial paced cycle lengths and reduced right atrial pressure (P < 0.05) but did not alter mean arterial pressure. After either combined vagal and beta-adrenergic blockade (vagotomy plus atropine plus propranolol, n = 7) or selective vagal blockade (n = 9), low-dose ANP no longer altered atrial ERP or MAPD90. Higher ANP doses (150 and 600 ng/kg per minute) decreased mean arterial and right atrial pressures (P < 0.001) but did not alter atrial ERP, MAPD90, or other electrophysiological parameters including atrial fibrillation threshold, ventricular ERP, and MAPD90. Conclusion: ANP has dose-dependent, autonomically mediated effects on atrial refractoriness and repolarization.

AB  - Corporations are increasingly implementing enterprise information technologies (EITs), because of the costs of maintaining legacy systems and the lack of fit of such systems for organization-wide information sharing, A new type of EIT that is being introduced in major corporations (such as Dell Computers), is based on the idea of component systems, which are stand-alone software programs that can integrate with other such components with relative ease. Given the financial outlay for EITs, the evaluation and adoption of these systems is not something that can be completed haphazardly. This requirement is complicated by the relative infancy of models for the evaluation of componentized EITs, To this end, in this paper, we introduce a managerial multistage multiattribute decision model, consisting of the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) model and the Supermatrix approach (also defined as the Analytical Network Processes (ANP) approach). This combination of models builds on earlier work that validates the Supermatrix approach for evaluating traditional EITs at a Fortune 100 organization. The aggregation of these benefits is then measured against the costs of systems, thereby arriving at a ranking of alternatives for each functional area. We illustrate the model with an example and draw managerial implications.

AB  - The analytic network process (ANP) is presented as a potentially valuable method to support the selection of projects in a research and development (R&D) environment. This paper first discusses the requirements of the R&D project selection problem, which requires the allocation of resources to a set of competing and often disparate project proposals. Among the factors complicating this task is the need to make the decision within the framework of an enterprise's strategic objectives and organizational structure while considering and integrating financial and strategic benefits of each project. The paper discusses the use of the ANP, a general form of Saaty's analytic hierarchy process, as a model to evaluate the value of competing R&D project proposals. A generic ANP model developed by the authors, which includes in its decision levels the actors involved in the decision, the stages of research, categories of metrics, and individual metrics, is presented. The paper concludes with a case study describing the implementation of this model at a small high-tech company, including data based on the actual use of the decision making model.
