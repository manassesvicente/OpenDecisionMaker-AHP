AB Webservices (WSs) are believed to be among the key technologies to
   enable the transformation of current static supply chains into dynamic
   virtual networks of enterprises. Others have said that these
   technologies are not yet ready for large-scale applications to supply
   chains and propose 'traditional' cross-enterprise integration methods.
   However, there is currently little research available that objectively
   evaluates the usefulness of WSs to enable smart business networks. In
   this study, this question is addressed through developing a typical
   scenario in which we transform a static supply chain into a 'loosely
   coupled' business network. We implement the scenario using
   state-of-the-art ` enterprise application integration' and WSs
   orchestration technology. The comparison of these alternative approaches
   reveals that WSs technology has some clear advantages above enterprise
   integration technology currently in use. However, there are also some
   limitations and research issues which are presented as a future research
   agenda for WSs technology.
