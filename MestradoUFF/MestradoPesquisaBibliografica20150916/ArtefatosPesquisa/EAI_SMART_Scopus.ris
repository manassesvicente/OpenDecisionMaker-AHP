AB  - Since its emergence, smart grid has been given increasingly widespread attentions. Basically, smart grid combines a various modern technologies like network communication, information processing and distributed control to provide a more secure, reliable and intelligent grid, thus meeting the requirements of future social and economic development. As a new paradigm in the power grid, smart grid undoubtedly represents the mainstream trend of future electric industry. As a result, it also brings some new technical challenges to researchers and engineering practioners. To support researchers and engineering practioners constructing a modern and intelligent grid, research in the field of smart grid has proliferated. In this paper, we look deeper into some key issues of smart grid, such as distributed cooperation and control, data and application integration, and knowledgebased comprehensive decision. Still, we give some solutions to resolve these challenges. In addition, we also introduce the concept of smart grid and define its key characteristics. Finally, we outline future directions of research and conclude the paper. Â© 2011 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.

AB  - Webservices (WSs) are believed to be among the key technologies to enable the transformation of current static supply chains into dynamic virtual networks of enterprises. Others have said that these technologies are not yet ready for large-scale applications to supply chains and propose 'traditional' cross-enterprise integration methods. However, there is currently little research available that objectively evaluates the usefulness of WSs to enable smart business networks. In this study, this question is addressed through developing a typical scenario in which we transform a static supply chain into a 'loosely coupled' business network. We implement the scenario using state-of-the-art 'enterprise application integration' and WSs orchestration technology. The comparison of these alternative approaches reveals that WSs technology has some clear advantages above enterprise integration technology currently in use. However, there are also some limitations and research issues which are presented as a future research agenda for WSs technology.

AB  - This paper describes research and development activities for integrating distributed information and knowledge with software agent technology. First, we give an overview of our software agent architecture. Then, we describe the application of our software agent technology in a system that integrates distributed databases and in a document-oriented information integration system which integrates search engines. Our agent-based approach is suitable for dynamic information sources.
