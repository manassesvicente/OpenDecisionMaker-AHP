AB  - As a result of emerging computation technologies, information systems are developed to support various processes of enterprises. ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) has been a leading EIS (Enterprise Information Systems) application and companies are allocating resources to such new projects. However, studies report that most of the projects fail or cannot reach the desired outcomes selecting inappropriate software is represented as one of the major sources for project failures. This paper focuses on EIS selection problem which is a multicriteria decision making (MCDM) problem since it contains various and conflicting criteria. In this study, a group decision making approach using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Interval type-2 fuzzy sets is used on a real world ERP selection problem with six criteria and four alternatives. The originality of the study comes from using interval type-2 fuzzy sets in the decision problem. By using interval type-2 fuzzy sets for handling fuzzy group decision-making probems more flexible decisions can be given since interval type-2 fuzzy sets are more suitable to represent uncertainties than type-1 fuzzy set.

AB  - The ever increasing Internet bandwidth and the fast changing needs of businesses for effectiveness with the partners in the procurement chain and is leading organizations to adopt information systems infrastructures that are cost effective as well as flexible. The question seems to be: what is driving organizations to go in for Software as a Service (SaaS) based e-procurement and ERP, rather than the packaged model of software provisioning? Whereas there have been studies reporting technology, cost, quality, network externalities and process as the main variables in the utility function of the user, but most of the studies have modelled either one or two in the their models. The study is exploratory in nature and tries to identify, classify and rank dimensions affecting SaaS sourcing decisions. In this study, we developed an integrative framework to identify the determinants of choice of SaaS in the specific context of SaaS based e-procurement and ERP. The framework was then analyzed using the extended Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method suggested by Liberatore (1987) and the relative importance and the weights of the criteria identified using data collected on 8 users and 9 service providers of SaaS based e-procurement and ERP. Although the analysis helped in identifying quality and costs as the two most important determinants of choice of SaaS based e-procurement and ERP, but the other criteria such as network externality benefits, technology and process were also found to be significant determinants of choice. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Simulation training plays a more and more important role in the teaching system in our colleges and universities. In the work points of the Ministry of education of 2013, construction of national experimental teaching demonstration center are one of the most important aspects. In this study, the simulation training is regarded as the research object and evaluated as an example. At first, this study introduces the related theory on the ERP and the system of business management and builds up an assessment system of college simulation training from five aspects. And then a comprehensive algorithm model of evaluation is proposed via AHP, and its application of the algorithm is tested with the simulation data coming from a business management of ERP course. Finally the study offers three countermeasures to improve the simulation training. © Sila Science. All rights reserved.

AB  - Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems that aimto integrate, synchronize and centralize organizational data are generally regarded as a vital tool for companies to be successful in the rapidly changing global marketplace. Due to its high acquisition-purchasing, installation and implementation-cost and the wide range of offerings, the selection of ERP systems is a strategically important and difficult decision. Since there is a wide range of tangible and intangible criteria to be considered, it is often defined as a multi-criteria decision making problem. To overcome the challenges imposed by the multifaceted nature of the problem, herein a three-stage hybrid methodology is proposed. The process starts with the identification of most prevailing criteria through a series of brainstorming sessions that include people from different organizational units. Then, due to the varying importance of the criteria, a fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process, which handles the vagueness inherent in the decision making process, is used to obtain the relative importance/weights of the criteria. Theseweighted criteria are then used as input to the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution method to rank the decision alternatives. As a real-world illustrative case, the proposed methodology is applied to the ERP selection problem at Turkish Airlines. Because of the collaborative and systematic nature of the methodology, the results obtained from the process were found to be highly satisfactory and trustworthy by the decision makers. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Recently, studies about the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) have been increased and this research area has attracted more attention. Especially, in the global competition environment, enterprises have to focus on their Information Systems (IS) performance to have a competitive advantage; implementing an ERP system and improving the effectiveness of the system is the only way. However every sector reacts to ERP implementation differently. Purpose of this study is to rank the sectors according to their performance increments after successful ERP implementations by using AHP-TOPSIS hybrid method. As a result, general structure of Turkish companies will be pictured and the sectors which have the most chance to improve their performance by utilizing an ERP system will be defined. These findings will help the companies to plan the implementation process more precisely and help the managers of these companies to define their expectations more clearly. A numerical example is given to clarify the main developed result in this paper. © 2014, Technical Gazette. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Automation systems for buildings interconnect components and technologies from the information technology industry and the telecommunications industry. In these industries, existing platforms and new platforms (that are designed to make building automation systems work) compete for market acceptance and consequently several platform battles among suppliers for building automation networking are being waged. It is unclear what the outcome of these battles will be and also which factors are important in achieving platform dominance. Taking the fuzziness of decision makers’ judgments into account, a fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making methodology called the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process is applied to investigate the importance of such factors in platform battles for building automation networking. We present the relative importance of the factors for three types of platforms (subsystem platforms, system platforms, and evolved subsystem platforms). The results provide a first indication that the set of important factors differs per type of platform. For example, when focusing on other stakeholders, for subsystem platforms, the previous installed base is of importance; for system platforms, the diversity of the network of stakeholders is essential; and for evolved subsystem platforms, the judiciary is an important factor. © 2014, Systems Engineering Society of China and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - In this paper we propose a combined AHP-IBA model for selecting the best SAP consultant for an SAP ERP project. The goal of the SAP Project Manager is to choose the best consultant, the one who is able to implement standard SAP functionalities with quality and on time. When making a decision on the basis of multiple criteria, the traditional Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method does not take into account the fact that attributes may correlate, assuming that there are no dependencies between them. However, the dependencies of the attributes can often be used to model important knowledge for multiple criteria decision analysis. We propose an extension to the traditional AHP method by applying Interpolative realization of Boolean algebra (IBA), using AHP to determine the criteria weights, and IBA to model the logical interactions among criteria. The research conducted on ERP consultant selection suggests that the decision making process is modelled more accurately if logical interactions between attributes are modelled before applying AHP. © 2014 Yugoslav Journal of Operations Research.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the market readiness to adopt the Cloud as the future ERP platform, by using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) decision support methodology. Design/methodology/approach: Interviewing is conducted on the convenient sample, of enterprises from various industries. The interview is conducted through expert telephone interview and self-administered questionnaire. Results are then used as a basis for forming the weight factors necessary for the AHP decision model. Data are analyzed and synthesized using AHP and Expert Choice. Findings: Results demonstrate a huge interest for TCO reduction, but also a concern for data privacy and availability. Large enterprises want their data on local servers, while smaller companies tend to act as "first adopters", mainly because of the cost benefits that Cloud offers. Finally, vendors see the hybrid solutions as the most suitable approach for the overall market, at least while current Cloud obstacles exist. Research limitations/implications: This research does not aim to answer the question what is the best solution for a particular industry. Instead, it assumes the general approach, which answers the question what would in general be the adequate solution for the SME and how much are SMEs ready to adopt the ERP in the Cloud. A further research is necessary to validate these results in practice. That research should be industry specific, i.e. narrowed to one industry only. Then, it would be possible to answer the question what is the best solution for high-tech SMEs. Practical implications: This paper summarizes Cloud pros and cons useful for decision makers to establish a starting point for IT reorganization. Additionally, AHP results provide some indications of the market's perception regarding Cloud and ERP, while vendors' statements about ERP-Cloud solutions provide an interesting glimpse of the ERP market in the next few years. Originality/value: Market demands constant flexibility and cost effectiveness, forcing companies to adapt faster than ever. Therefore, there is a significant risk for first adopters and their business if they adopt an inadequate solution. This paper offers a high-level overview of the SME's market understanding and willingness to adopt ERP in the Cloud idea, and it demonstrates how the AHP decision support methodology can be used to assess the readiness of enterprises to adopt the Cloud-ERP solution. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - An enterprise resource planning (ERP) system is an information system that supports and integrates many facets of a business. A critical issue in ERP implementation is how to bridge the gap between the ERP system and an organization's business processes by customizing either the system, or the business processes of the organization, or both. Literature review shows that customization is a major hindrance in most of the ERP implementation projects. This research applies nominal group technique (NGT) and analytical hierarchy process (AHP) techniques to Luo and Strong's framework to help organizations determine feasible customization choices for their ERP implementation initiatives. A case study is presented to illustrate its applicability in practice. The study has theoretical and practical implications for our understanding of ERP implementation process. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Purpose-Customization is a difficult task for many organizations implementing enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. The purpose of this paper is to develop a new framework based on customers’ requirements to examine the ERP customization choices for the enterprise. The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) technique has been applied complementarily with this framework to prioritize ERP customization choices. Design/methodology/approach-Based on empirical literature, the paper proposed an ERP customization framework anchored on the customer’s requirements. A case study research method was used to evaluate the applicability of the framework in a real-life setting. In a case study with 15 practitioners working on the vendor’s and the client’s sides in an ERP implementation, the paper applied the framework jointly with the AHP technique to prioritize the feasible customization choices for ERP implementation. Findings-The paper demonstrates the applicability of the framework in identifying the various feasible choices for the client organization to consider when they decide to customize their selected ERP product. Research limitations/implications-Further case studies need to be carried out in various contexts to acquire knowledge about the generalizability of the observations. This will also contribute to refining the proposed ERP customization framework. Practical implications-Very few literature sources suggest methods for exploring and evaluating customization options in ERP projects from requirements engineering perspective. The proposed framework helps practitioners and consultants anchor the customization decisions on the customer’s requirements and use a well-established prioritization technique, AHP, to identify the feasible customization choices for the implementing enterprise. Originality/value-No previously published research studies provide an approach to prioritize customization choices for ERP anchored on the customer’s requirements. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - The promotion of pharmaceutical company is enabled by effective decision making deciphered through computer packages like SAP, ERP, Data Warehouse. Its implementation and application across the entire system of pharma business transforms the pharma companies from just manufacturers of medicines into managers of health for all. The company can better serve the stakeholders such as doctors, physicians, surgeons, medical representatives and ultimately patients. These valued customers actually establish the products and enable emergence of a product as a “Brand Leader”. Data analytics projects, brings forth the same type of pharma problems in the past and present statistics, and helps identify variegated alternatives so that decision is reached gradually. AHP software deals with decision problems that can be structured hierarchically. The desired goal is evaluated with respect to the criteria that each subsumes an entire set of alternatives. Questionnaire administered to 70 pharmaceutical company managers resulted in the present study of use of data analytics in pharma business. The study mainly examine the utility of computers and the software pertaining to market potential assessment, identification of unmet medical need, the degree of market competition and the intellectual property positions of pharma companies in selecting their target for drug discovery. The computers today play an important role to get all required past and present statistics to analyze different alternatives and there by arrive at the decisions. So using a Questionnaire with sample size of 70 a study is done to find out various factors relating to usage of computers by various managers in their everyday business life. Significant advances in computer software and hardware have also played a major role by providing the “computer power” necessary to treat decision problems more realistically. In pharmaceutical research, especially in large pharmaceutical companies where many projects are going on simultaneously, many of the same types of decision problems exist. © 2014, Global Research Online.

AB  - In the recent years ERP systems have received much attention. An enterprise resource planning system (ERP) is the information backbone of a company that integrates and automates all business operations. In spite of considerable changes that the implementation of such systems at all levels of the organization will bring about, lack precision in selecting appropriate ERP systems leads to irreparable damage for the organization. So, it is a critical issue to select the suitable ERP system which meets all the business strategies and the goals of the company. This paper has tried to introduce a method for selecting ERP system by using fuzzy theory and fuzzy multiple criteria decision making. The methodology was applied for Iranian manufacturing company.

AB  - Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is a product that enables organizations achieving their competitive advantage. However, the failures of ERP implementation are still considered quite high. This research was conducted to formulate the framework of self-assessment of open source ERP implementation readiness, which focused on the ERP pre-implementation aspects. The proposed ERP implementation readiness assessment framework was developed using the Fuzzy-based ANP (Fuzzy ANP), where the examined readiness factors are grouped into three categories, namely project management, organizational, and change management readiness. In order to see the application of the framework, we conducted a case study on an SME engaged in software development. We did focus group discussion with Chief Technology Officer, Chief Strategy Officer and Project Manager. The results showed that the company is not ready to implement open source ERP. Although the company is strong in the human resources aspect, they are still weak in other aspects so that they need some strategies to improve their level of readiness before implementing open source ERP. © 2013 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.

AB  - Enterprise Resource planning (ERP) Systems as standard software packages have been welcomed in most of industries. Although implementation of these systems needs considering issues to achieve the success and planned aspiration levels. In order to identifying and classifying these issues as ERP Critical Success Factors (CSFs), various researches have been done and the importances of these factors were discussed. As considerable area, the degree of influence of factors involved in ERP project is a room for investigation. In this paper, with considering the degree of influence factors on each other, a hybrid model was proposed based on fuzzy analytical hierarchy process analysis and fuzzy DEMATEL to evaluate and assess the critical factors in ERP project implementation. Finding the cause and effect relationship between factors and the influence degree on each other was the main contribution of case study of current research on an Iranian steel company. In the case company the cause and grounds factor were identified as: "clear project plan", "training and education", "project champion", project team competence and organizational culture by utilizing FAHP-DEMATEL hybrid model. © IDOSI Publications, 2013.

AB  - The adoption of ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) by companies has introduced the need of evaluating and selecting such systems. This discussion is embedded in a context of multiple perceptions or evaluation criteria. In the present study, it a systematic literature review was conducted on a set of papers published in journals indexed by Scopus, ISI Web of Science, and Engineering Village databases focusing on the multiple criteria evaluation of ERP systems. Based on this literature review, criteria and sub-criteria was set, which was submitted for validation by a group of professionals with strong ERP System selection and implementation experience resulting in a tree comprised of 45 sub-criteria grouped into five criteria. A survey of IT and civil construction areas was conducted on a sample of 79 respondents in order to investigate the relative importance of these criteria. The survey demonstrated that the Financial, Business, and Software criteria were considered by the respondents as the most important.

AB  - This study uses the multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) to evaluate the integration project of the MES into ERP modules in a PCB company of Taiwan. The MCDM was applied to filter the indicators of the effectiveness after the integration of modules, and derived the weights of indicator. The result of this study shows that the cost indicator is the most important indicator in integrating MES into ERP. This study also can be the reference for researchers to derive the performance indicators of ERP and MES systems.

AB  - An enterprise resource planning (ERP) system is a software solution that puts together a package that allows information flow through various levels and departments of an organisation. Manufacturing enterprises have understood the importance of information systems within their organisations and have begun using them extensively. To achieve the right fit of the ERP system to the business organisation, customisation may be needed. However, customisation is seen as an issue in the application of an ERP. There are many attributes that can be considered for the selection of an ERP system. In this paper, we have applied fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) to a framework to evaluate an ERP for implementation purposes. The framework provides different methods for customisation of ERP. With the use of FAHP, obtained results provide a better match in terms of understanding the problem and giving options that are a closer fit to the requirements rather than providing the correct decision to be taken. This paper is aimed at helping managers to understand and select among the various customisation options available. The application of FAHP to the framework is demonstrated with opinions gathered from managers in various companies. These opinions are translated into numerical values and are compared to the problem as a whole. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Selecting a proper system of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is amajor challenge for enterprise managers. Heavy expenses of incorrect decisions in selection of ERP systems have made academics and managers consider this phase as highly important. Several research studies proposed different approaches to selecting the ERP and many case studies of organizational experiences have been published. However, there has been less regard for simultaneous use of the findings of academic studies and judgments of industrial experts or organization mangers for making the most appropriate choice. This study proposes ac ombined multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach through which both previous studies and judgments of industrial experts or organization managers would be integrated in order to select the proper ERP system. Having studied the literature comprehensively and conducted interviews with experts and managers, this approach will determine the most important criteria in ERP selection using Shannon entropy technique. Then, based on the judgments obtained from experts and using DEMATEL technique, these criteria will be classified into the two groups of "Cause" and "Effect" and the most appropriate choice will be selected using Fuzzy AHP technique. Finally, a case study is conducted to demonstrate and prove the applicability of the proposed approach. Copyright © 2012, IGI Global.

AB  - This paper applies an analytic hierarchical prediction model based on the Multi-Criteria Decision Making with Incomplete Linguistic Preference Relations (InLinPreRa) to help the organizations become aware of the essential factors affecting the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), as well as identify the actions necessary before implementing ERP. The subjectivity and vagueness in the prediction procedures are dealt with linguistic variables quantified in an interval [-t, t]. Then predicted success/failure values are obtained to enable organizations to decide whether to initiate ERP, inhibit adoption or take remedial actions to increase the success possibility of ERP. Pairwise comparisons are used to determine the priority weights of influential factors, and the possible occurrence ratings of success or failure outcome amongst decision makers. There are not any inconsistency occurred in this procedures because this proposed approach allows every decision expert to choose an explicit criterion or alternative for the without restriction. When there are n criteria in a decision matrix, only n-1 times of pairwise comparisons are taken. This approach not only improves the efficiency of pairwise comparison compared with the traditional AHP, but also avoids the checking the consistency of linguistic preference relation when the decision makers undertake the pairwise comparison processes. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Improperly selected ERP software may have an impact on the time required, and the costs and market share of a company, selecting the best desirable ERP software has been the most critical problem for a long time. On the other hand, selecting ERP software is a multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem, and in the literature, many methods have been introduced to evaluate this kind of problem, which has been widely used in MCDM selection problems. In this paper, an integrated approach of ERP software selection analytic hierarchy process improved by rough sets theory (Rough-AHP) and fuzzy TOPSIS method is proposed to obtain final ranking.

AB  - Benefits of integrated information systems such as ERP (Enterprise resource planning) without suitable infrastructures and successful implementation, is low. The first step For ERP successful implementation as one of the most important management tools and the most effective information systems is choosing it on the base of various quantitative and qualitative criteria. Multi criteria decision- making (MCDM) theory is a suitable method for solving problems that they have sometimes antonymous many factors and parameters. For this purpose, we intend to describe ERP selection criterion and introduce its best sellers perfectly to help managers who want to buy and implement this system. In this research we have tried to use of decision techniques and combine with goal programming to choose an opportune ERP, for TUGA company -the only manufacturer of gas turbines in Iran- a satellite company of Iran power plant projects management organization and present a model for selection process.

AB  - Over the last few years, software multinational corporations and local software houses have started to target the small/medium enterprises (SMEs) to sell their solutions. SMEs are confronted with problems which are peculiar to this segment and hence solution approach should differ as that from large scale organisations. The objective of the research presented here is to explore the issues which the SMEs can find decisive for ensuring success. The researchers proposes a framework which can help SMEs while choosing an appropriate package for implementation given that there are multiple decision criteria such as appropriateness, cost, vendor support and training. This study is based on feedback that has been obtained from 100+ small and medium scale manufacturers, whose responses have been analysed to highlight the issues namely reducing costs, improving their inventory scenario and developing agile customer responsive system. The results of the study would benefit the leading ERP vendors offering the products. Copyright © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Therefore, this research attempts to present an objective and quantitative assessment model based on the Balance Scorecard approach for the purpose of appraising the performance of the ERP system. The methodology used in this research involves the Grounded Theory, Expert Questionnaire, the Analytic Hierarchy Process, and the Fuzzy Theory to filter out and develop the KPIs for the ERP system performance assessment model. It is expected that such a model may be used by enterprises to assess the efficiency of the ERP system during the various stages of management and support within the system. Finally, this assessment model is verified in a case company through the examination of its unbiased and quantifiable assessment approach. This result allows us to further understand authentic efficiency, and explore if enterprises have fulfilled their proposed objectives after the introduction of the ERP system. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software selection is one of the most important decision making issues covering both qualitative and quantitative factors for organizations. Multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) has been found to be a useful approach to analyze these conflicting factors. Qualitative criteria are often accompanied by ambiguities and vagueness. This makes fuzzy logic a more natural approach to this kind of problems. This study presents a beneficial structure to the managers for use in ERP software vendor selection process. In order to evaluate ERP vendors methodologically, a hierarchical framework is also proposed. As a MCDM tool, we used analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and its fuzzy extension to obtain more decisive judgments by prioritizing criteria and assigning weights to the alternatives. The objective of this paper is to select the most appropriate alternative that meets the customer's requirements with respect to cost and quality constraints. In the end of this study, a real-world case study from Turkey is also presented to illustrate efficiency of the methodology and its applicability inpractice. © 2010-IOS Press and the authors.

AB  - Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems cannot remain static after their implementation, they need maintenance. ERP maintenance is a key process required by the rapidly changing business environment and the usual software maintenance needs. However, these projects are highly complex and risky. So, the risks management associated with ERP maintenance projects is crucial to attain a satisfactory performance. Unfortunately, ERP maintenance risks have not been studied in depth. For this reason, this paper presents a general risks taxonomy. It gathers together the risks affecting the performance of ERP maintenance. Moreover, the authors use the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) methodology to analyze the risks factors identified. It helps managers, vendors, consultants, auditors, users and IT staff to manage ERP maintenance better. Results suggest that the most critical stage in ERP maintenance is the first phase, which receives, identifies, classifies and ranks the software modification. The most important hazards in ERP maintenance are the cooperation and commitment of ERP users and managers. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - A Digital Factory is a concept which improves the collaboration among product development processes. Despite the benefits brought by this concept, failures may occur in its implementation. This paper aims to present the Critical Success Factors in the implementation of a Digital Factory project in a Brazilian company. These factors were identified by an exploratory survey on the implementation of Enterprise Resource Planning and Product Lifecycle Management among other systems. Following this identification, the factors were prioritized using the Delphi Method and the Analytic Hierarchy Process; this evaluation was carried out by professionals from enterprises which implement Digital Factory projects, in Brazil and abroad. Nine factors were identified. The five main priorities were: Continuous Support and Commitment from Top Management; Comprehensive Business Reengineering; Skilled and Experienced Partners; Participation and Commitment of Users; and Appropriate Role of the Project Manager.

AB  - This project involved working with a medical device manufacturing company currently in the process of identifying a new ERP system. This research aims to help in the decision making process, selection and implementation of the new system. The methodology used in this paper involved request for information (RFI), analytical hierarchical process (AHP), technology implementation envelope (TIE) and the technology acceptance model (TAM). RFI were sent to several vendors and six responses were received which were used to score each alternative in an AHP model. The result of the AHP model outputted the best alternative with respects to this company's goals. Next, the different modules that make up the ERP system were assessed and TAM was used quantify the user's perception and attitudes towards the system. With these two pieces of information, TIE was used in order to determine the best possible implementation plan for the system. This project's end result will identify the best alternative to select and propose an ERP system for the medical device manufacturer; however, due to confidentiality agreements the name of the vendor will not be disclosed.

AB  - Outsourcing can be seen as a strategic way to align technology initiatives and business goals, as a strategy for managing technology operations in today's difficult business environment, and as a way to reduce operating costs. Often, companies begin the process by outsourcing non-core business operations, which may include applications, assets, people and other resources. The outsourcing decision is important since the correct selection can dramatically increase a firm's performance. When companies outsource a significant part of their business and become more dependent on outsourcers, the consequences of poor decision making becomes more severe. Since enterprise resource planning (ERP) is one of the vital systems, if not the one, that integrates all functions including planning, manufacturing, distribution, and accounting into a single system, its outsourcing is a very important multi-attribute decision problem for the firms. In the literature, outsourcing decisions are often based on multi-criteria approaches. In this paper, a fuzzy multi-criteria decision making methodology is suggested for the selection among ERP outsourcing alternatives. The methodology is based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) under fuzziness. It allows decision-makers to express their evaluations in linguistic expressions, crisp or fuzzy numbers. In the application of the proposed methodology, an automotive firm selects the best alternative among three ERP outsourcing firms.

AB  - An enterprise resource planning system (ERP) is the information backbone of a company that integrates and automates all business operations. It is a critical issue to select the suitable ERP system which meets all the business strategies and the goals of the company. This study presents an approach to select a suitable ERP system for textile industry. Textile companies have some difficulties to implement ERP systems such as variant structure of products, production variety and unqualified human resources. At first, the vision and the strategies of the organization are checked by using balanced scorecard. According to the company's vision, strategies and KPIs, we can prepare a request for proposal. Then ERP packages that do not meet the requirements of the company are eliminated. After strategic management phase, the proposed methodology gives advice before ERP selection. The criteria were determined and then compared according to their importance. The rest ERP system solutions were selected to evaluate. An external evaluation team consisting of ERP consultants was assigned to select one of these solutions according to the predetermined criteria. In this study, the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process, a fuzzy extension of the multi-criteria decision-making technique AHP, was used to compare these ERP system solutions. The methodology was applied for a textile manufacturing company. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Retailing is a diverse and dynamic industry offering a wide range of goods and services to consumers.There is also an increasing recognition that this corporate retail power is the driving force for the whole of the supply chain. Due to these facts, it is argued that retailing companies have a huge potential to impact on sustainability performance of national economies. In order to materialize this potential, performance in sustainability should be assessed, and evaluating sustainability performance of an industry requires developing a system of performance evaluation framework. In the context of sustainable development, selecting proper sustainability indicators are one of the most crucial steps to fulfill performance evaluations. Since there has been no attempt to develop proper sustainability indicators in retailing industry, this paper aims to select appropriate indicators for future evaluation of industrial sustainability performance for grocery retailing in terms of three sustainability aspects: social, environmental and economic. To this end, (1) a comprehensive analysis of the existing literature was done, (2) and Analytic Hierarchy Process/ Weighted Additive model-based table was developed to rank the indicators for each aspect, (3) the input for the tables was obtained from rapidly growing grocery retailing industry in Turkey by conducting surveys, and (4) using the average values of the tables, sustainability indicators for each aspect were ranked and the most appropriate ones were selected.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore selection of the best ERP suppliers in the clothing industry by using analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Design/methodology/approach - AHP is used in order to achieve the paper's purpose; selection criteria are determined by managers and experts. Findings - Three different enterprise resource planning (ERP) suppliers are investigated and best alternative is selected by using AHP. After the best alternative is selected, cost benefit analysis is calculated in order to define decisive result. All calculations are verified by performing the consistency test. Research limitations/implications - Selection criteria and their evaluations can be changed depending on size of the clothing manufacturer and product type. Originality/value - The results of the study will be helpful to clothing manufacturers which plan to implement an ERP system in their organizations. Furthermore, they can use AHP in other decision problems as well. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Enterprise resource planning (ERP) system selection is very important for a company as it completely affects production and service methodology of enterprises. Moreover, ERP selection is getting increasingly difficult because of a large variety of ERP software solutions available. The current study aims to select the most appropriate software between two elected candidates after some analysis for the final decision by using a technique with analytic hierarchy process (AHP) support in a factory which is planning to use ERP software that fits its functions. © 2008 Springer-Verlag London Limited.

AB  - In Vendor Selection Process the most important issue is to determine a suitable decision-making method for selecting the best Vendor. Essentially the Vendor Selection Problem (VSP) is a multi-criteria decision making problem involving tangible as well as intangible criterion. Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) can best handle these criterions. But AHP fails to address the issue of interdependencies among and between different levels of attributes. ANP provides a holistic framework for selection of best Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) vendor alternative by using a dynamic multi-directional relationship among the decision attributes. Also ANP equipped with fuzzy logic helps in overcoming the impreciseness or vagueness in the preferences. The method adopted here uses triangular fuzzy numbers for pair-wise comparison of attributes and weights are calculated using entropy concept. A practical example explains our concept and also a comparison is made with crisp ANP. © Medwell Journals, 2008.

AB  - Purpose - This study aims to provide a good insight into the use of analytic network process (ANP), a multi-criteria decision-making methodology in selecting and benchmarking enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. Design/methodology/approach - In this study, ANP model is proposed with an actual case example in selecting the best ERP system as a framework to guide managers. Findings - This model provides firms with a simple, flexible and easy to use approach to evaluate ERP systems efficiently. Findings demonstrate that the ANP model, with minor modifications, can be useful to all firms in their ERP system selection decisions. Research limitations/implications - ANP is a highly complex methodology and requires more numerical calculations in assessing composite priorities than the traditional analytic hierarchy process and hence it increases the effort. Originality/value - This is probably the first time that an attempt has been made to apply the ANP model in ERP system selection decisions. ANP has the ability to be used as a decision-making analysis tool since it incorporates feedback and interdependent relationships among decision criteria and alternatives. In addition, evaluation and selection of ERP system software can be very useful for both academic research and practice. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - An enterprise resource planning (ERP) system is a critical investment that can significantly affect future competitiveness and performance of a company. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method is often applied to select an ERP system since it is well suited to multiple criteria decision-making problems. This study presents a simulation-based AHP (SiAHP) method for group decision making and is applied to the real-world problem of selecting a suitable ERP system for a Korean homeshopping company. To enhance the fitness of a group AHP method and to facilitate the ERP system selection process, this paper proposes a simulation-based approach for building a group consensus instead of forming point estimates that are aggregated from individual preference judgments. To be specific, the proposed method is based on observations from empirically observed frequency distributions and does not use aggregation procedures, compared to typical group AHP for obtaining a group solution. This approach, reflecting the diversification of group members' opinions as they are, is conceived to be useful as a tool for obtaining insights into agreements and disagreements with respect to the alternatives among the individuals of a group. The real-world example demonstrates the feasibility of our proposed approach. © 2008 Operational Research Society Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - After the outbreak of numerous accounting-related scandals, the significance of internal control became the focus of the public's attention. In order to recover investors' confidence in the capital market, US President Bush signed into law the Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Act in 2002. Using the view that the SOX Act enhances internal control over financial reporting as the basis, we explore elements of internal control in Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system environments. We build an internal control framework with 5 dimensions and 19 detailed factors. Then, we use the framework in our survey of Taiwan, public companies that implement ERP systems. We find that the five most important internal control factors are as follows. (1) Establishment of Information Technology (IT) organisations and their relations; (2) integration and communication of financial information; (3) development of IT strategic plans; (4) management of information quality; (5) monitoring of operating procedures.

AB  - A new selection method for ERP of manufacturing enterprise was developed. Firstly, an evaluation model of ERP selection process was established, and an evaluation system for ERP selection was constructed by using balanced score card (BSC). According to benchmarking principle, the referred series was obtained for ERP selection. All the relative weights were calculated based on the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) technique. Then, the priority scheduling of ERP software was realized via the grey relational theory. Finally, a practice example analysis was carried on. The results show that the method is comprehensive, practical and operational for ERP selection.

AB  - The paper proposes a new approach for sustainability appraisal in development projects in Serbia by using the analytic hierarchy process as a group decision-making framework. Selection of the most acceptable location for pumping stations in the Galovica drainage area is chosen for the case study. Three experts (an ecologist, a hydro-engineer and a local authority representative) evaluated three alternative locations regarding technical, economical, environmental and social criteria. Sensitivity analysis shows that the group decision will remain stable unless the importance weight of the hydro-engineer is set to 0.9 or higher.

AB  - ERP (enterprise resource planning) is a management information system that optimizes distribution of enterprise resources and helps a business to integrate all its resources for fast and effective application to improve its operational performance and enhance its competitiveness. Consequently, a failure evaluation model for introducing ERP, together with the factors and reasons for failures are presented in this research, acting as a reference for businesses when planning and making important decisions on ERP. This study uses the DMAIC of the 6-Sigma approach and a failure evaluation model for introducing ERP that involves expert opinions, a questionnaire, V-shaped performance evaluation matrix (PEM), statistical methods, QFD & FMEA (quality function deployment & failure mode and effects analysis) methods, and QFD & AHP (quality function deployment & analytic hierarchy process) methods to find 6 key success factors and 8 key strategies for introducing ERP. The results of empirical application indicate that internal employee complaints were reduced, supply efficiency of chain suppliers was increased, and customer complaints about quality were decreased. Therefore, the approach presented in this paper is truly effective for business. It is hoped that these key factors can serve as references for other enterprises when introducing ERP. © 2007 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.

AB  - Supply chain coordination (SCC) is an effective approach to improve supply chain (SC) performance. The coordination can be achieved when interdependent entities work together by sharing resources and information to achieve common objectives aligned to maximise customer value for the entire SC. There are a number of mechanisms by which the SC members can coordinate, e.g. contracts, information sharing, information technology and collaborative initiatives. To communicate frequently and effectively, the partners are required to have good information systems and capability to share information. To coordinate with each other the SC members are required to have capabilities to implement coordination mechanisms effectively. In this paper, a model is proposed to measure the effect of these mechanisms on the extent of coordination. Currently, there is no scale of measurement reported in the literature to measure the SCC. A fuzzy logic approach combined with the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is proposed to evaluate the extent of coordination. The proposed methodology is demonstrated through a case study of an automotive parts manufacturer.

AB  - During the implementations of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, most companies have experienced some problems, one of which is how to determine the best ERP software satisfying their needs and expectations. Because improperly selected ERP software may have an impact on the time required, and the costs and market share of a company, selecting the best desirable ERP software has been the most critical problem for a long time. On the other hand, selecting ERP software is a multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem, and in the literature, many methods have been introduced to evaluate this kind of problem, one of which is the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), which has been widely used in MCDM selection problems. However, in this paper, we use a fuzzy extension of an analytic network process (ANP), a more general form of AHP, which uses uncertain human preferences as input information in the decision-making process, because the AHP cannot accommodate the variety of interactions, dependencies, and feedback between higher- and lower-level elements. Instead of using the classical eigenvector prioritization method in the AHP, only employed in the prioritization stage of ANP, a fuzzy-logic method providing more accuracy on judgements is applied. The resulting fuzzy ANP enhances the potential of the conventional ANP for dealing with imprecise and uncertain human comparison judgements. In short, in this paper, an intelligent approach to ERP software selection through a fuzzy ANP is proposed by taking into consideration quantitative and qualitative elements to evaluate ERP software alternatives.

AB  - A quantitative technique for evaluating the implementation capacity of enterprise resource planning (ERP) was developed to improve the efficiency and success rate of ERP implementation of manufacturing enterprises. A stepped ERP implementation model was presented and an implementation capacity e-valuation architecture was designed by using balanced scorecard (BSC). Then analytic hierarchy processes (AHP)-comprehensive fuzzy evaluation theory was used to quantitatively calculate the ERP implementation capacity, and the relationship between the calculation result and the phase of the stepped implementation model was also established. According to the evaluated implementation capacity, the critical success factors were found out and the corresponding effective measures were provided for guiding the ERP implementation processes. Finally, the proposed technique was illustrated by a case study of ERP implementation process in an enterprise.

AB  - Recently, companies have developed Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. ERP systems will integrate business processes and provide information. However, successful ERP implementation is costly and requires a long time to complete. Companies usually use outside consultants to ensure a successful ERP project. ERP consultant selection is a difficult task for an ERP project implementation. This study examined the users' service quality satisfaction in the ERP consultant selection and investigated performance improvement of ERP systems. We illustrated how to apply the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to set priority weights for consultant alternatives in order to solve the ERP consultant selection problems.

AB  - This paper comparatively analyzes the systems in Australia and Canada from the perspective of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation's Technical Guidelines for Responsible Fisheries No. 8. The results show that the key factors in the success of the Australian system are public participation, selecting an indicator with its objectives and improving management performance by the evaluation of the system. Further, the boundaries of the SFDIS should be the same as the boundaries of the management units and fisheries should be examined independently. The framework chosen by the Canadian system is more all-round, and can be combined with the PSR framework to maximize the management effects. Finally, techniques and specialist software such as fuzzy AHP etc. are 'well-suited to measuring weights and have the potential to be applied elsewhere'. Visual presentation is the best way to promote communication with the public. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation's kite diagram and the Sustainable Development Committee's dashboard of sustainability are two excellent visualizations.

AB  - Enterprise Resource Planning Systems (ERP) have become critical elements in the manufacturing field. An ERP system consists of a set of managerial tools that support the decision-making process, generate full integration among the functional areas of the company, produce high levels of productivity in the supply chain and reduce the company costs and inventories, among many other benefits. However, the ERP software selection process is not an easy task and needs special attention. In order to make this process as effective and efficient as possible, a model is proposed in this article. This model allows companies to find the alternative most suitable for the organization requirements, considering the experience of other companies that have already used ERP systems in order to obtain efficiency in the selection process as well as in the system implementation and operation. The model takes into account the expertise from Venezuelan companies, that have previously implemented ERP software and allow the organization to incorporate their specific needs and particular criteria, as input variables. The model was developed based on the article: «Factors for the selection of ERP software in large manufacturing companies: the Venezuelan case» [Castro, 2004], applying the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and using statistical tools as cluster analysis.

AB  - Enterprises recently tend to implement their new enterprise information systems like the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system in order to gain their competitive advantages and bring up their business efficiency, but the efficiency gained from this new implementation is not quite clear and is difficult to be identified. This paper presents an empirical research aiming to measure how business efficiencies in terms of scale efficiency and technical efficiency are influenced by the implementation of the ERP system. Six cases of large-scale companies in Taiwan are investigated. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) are the two main analytic methods used in this measurement. The key decision variables with their weights, which may significantly impact on business efficiencies, are firstly identified by employing AHP and then used by the DEA model to measure business relative efficiencies resulting from ERP implementation. Through this hybrid approach of objectively quantified analysis, we attempt to obtain more reliable business efficiency, which is truly affected by the implementation of ERP system.

AB  - To improve selection method of information systems in overall planning for enterprise application systems, a decision model based on the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) was proposed to evaluate the application systems. An index system including strategy matching, business support, application foundation, cost and return as primary evaluation factors was established for the model. Evaluation data of core business in overall planning was obtained through fuzzy judgment and it could be used to make quantificational decisions. The research was designed to transfer the decision problem from qualitative decision to quantificational decision which would be favorable to successful implementation of information system in enterprises.

AB  - For academics and practitioners concerned with computer-based information systems, one central issue is the study of critical success factors (CSF) of information systems development and implementation. Whereas several critical success factors analyses appear in the literature, most of them do not have any technical background. In this paper, we propose the use of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to set critical success factors priorities. Results suggest that technical elements are less critical than information and human factors and that an adequate knowledge of the information requirements of users is the most important critical success factors related with executive information systems (EIS). © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - An Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system is a critical investment that can significantly affect future competitiveness and performance of a company. This study presents a comprehensive framework for selecting a suitable ERP system. The framework can systematically construct the objectives of ERP selection to support the business goals and strategies of an enterprise, identify the appropriate attributes, and set up a consistent evaluation standard for facilitating a group decision process. A real-world example demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed framework. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to resolve the resource scheduling problem in Manufacturing Grid (MG), Manufacturing Grid Resource Scheduler (MGRS) based Quality of Service (QoS) was proposed. The entire scheduling process could be classified as QoS-based resource search, QoS-based resource scheduling and dynamic negotiation. Detailed studies on resources scheduling process were conducted. Based on the detailed definitions of manufacturing task/sub-task and resource, a Resource Task Matching (RTM) matrix was set up to show the scheduling objectives. At the same time, the concept of Group decision-making Fuzzy Analytic hierarchy process Model (GFAM) was put forward with resources' QoS attributes as evaluation rules and Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and Group Decision-Making (GDM) as algorithms. Furthermore, the application of GFAM was tested in an application case to illustrate its feasibility and practicability.

AB  - This paper proposes a practical two-phase approach to substation optimization planning. First, the initial substation planning project is obtained without taking into account the geographical information; secondly, the surrounding geographical information is considered in detail, and the geographical fitness degree is obtained by using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Then the global fitness degree of every project is evaluated when incorporating the economic fitness degree and finally the more rational optimization project is acquired. Some engineering applications indicate that the approach can better meet the practical planning requirements.

AB  - Various figures have stated that ERP (enterprise resource planning) systems have become one of the largest IT investments in recent years. The implementation of ERP system, however, is not an easy task. Previous research reports unusually high failure in ERP projects, sometimes jeopardizing the core operation of the implementing organization. The most famous case is FoxMeyer filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Further, ERP systems appear to present unique ongoing risks due to its uniqueness. In this study, we used a Delphi method to identify potential ERP projects risk factors, and constructed an AHP-based framework to analyze and then prioritized the ERP projects risk factors. The result reveals that some important risk factors deserve more attention during the implementation of ERP projects.

AB  - Corporations are increasingly implementing enterprise information technologies (EITs), because of the costs of maintaining legacy systems and the lack of fit of such systems for organization-wide information sharing, A new type of EIT that is being introduced in major corporations (such as Dell Computers), is based on the idea of component systems, which are stand-alone software programs that can integrate with other such components with relative ease. Given the financial outlay for EITs, the evaluation and adoption of these systems is not something that can be completed haphazardly. This requirement is complicated by the relative infancy of models for the evaluation of componentized EITs, To this end, in this paper, we introduce a managerial multistage multiattribute decision model, consisting of the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) model and the Supermatrix approach (also defined as the Analytical Network Processes (ANP) approach). This combination of models builds on earlier work that validates the Supermatrix approach for evaluating traditional EITs at a Fortune 100 organization. The aggregation of these benefits is then measured against the costs of systems, thereby arriving at a ranking of alternatives for each functional area. We illustrate the model with an example and draw managerial implications.

AB  - The analytic network process (ANP) is presented as a potentially valuable method to support the selection of projects in a research and development (R&D) environment. This paper first discusses the requirements of the R&D project selection problem, which requires the allocation of resources to a set of competing and often disparate project proposals. Among the factors complicating this task is the need to make the decision within the framework of an enterprise's strategic objectives and organizational structure while considering and integrating financial and strategic benefits of each project. The paper discusses the use of the ANP, a general form of Saaty's analytic hierarchy process, as a model to evaluate the value of competing R&D project proposals. A generic ANP model developed by the authors, which includes in its decision levels the actors involved in the decision, the stages of research, categories of metrics, and individual metrics, is presented. The paper concludes with a case study describing the implementation of this model at a small high-tech company, including data based on the actual use of the decision making model.
