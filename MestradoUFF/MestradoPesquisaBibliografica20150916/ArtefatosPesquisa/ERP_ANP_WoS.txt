AB Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, which integrates all of the
   units within an organization at the information level, plays an
   important role for a successful enterprise. With the right ERP system,
   it is easier to provide coordination.between the units, eliminate waste
   and make faster and better decisions. Adopting an ERP system is a
   significant investment decision for a firm, therefore a great deal of
   attention should be given to the selection of the right system. Since
   there are a large number of criteria to consider in selecting an ERP
   system, the process itself is regarded as a complex multi-criteria
   decision making problem. In this study, two prevalent multi-criteria
   decision making techniques, Analytic Network Process (ANP) and
   Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations
   (PROMETHEE), are used in combination to better address the ERP selection
   problem. First, ANP is used to determine the weights of all criteria,
   and then, the obtained weights are used in the PROMETHEE method for
   optimal ranking of the alternative system choices. To demonstrate the
   viability of the proposed methodology, an application case is performed
   on the ERP selection problem for the Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in
   Istanbul, Turkey. The proposed hybrid methodology successfully ranked
   the alternatives and identified the best ERP system based on the
   information obtained from a number of SMEs participated in this study.

AB The aim of this paper was to evaluate the risk level for both
   intra-organizational cultures and for different industries in
   implementing an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. This study
   adopts the Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (FANP) method to assess ERP
   implementation risks, which were categorized into four dimensions:
   management and execution, software system, users, and technology
   planning. An empirical survey was conducted that utilized the collected
   survey data of 20 ERP experts in Taiwan to assess, rank, and improve the
   critical risks of ERP implementation via the FANP method. Based on the
   results of the FANP method, a follow-up survey of ERP end-users in
   different departments of three industries was conducted to assess how
   intra-organizational cultures and cross-industries affect users'
   perceived risks a real world scenario. Our research results demonstrated
   that "lack of management support and assistance" is vital risk for a
   successful ERP implementation. Top management support and involvement
   are crucial and essential factors to the success of a firm's ERP
   implementation. "Ineffective communication with users" was found to be
   the second highest risk factor. The benefits of using the FANP method
   for evaluating the risk factors come from the clear priority weights
   between alternatives. Finally, this study provides suggestions to help
   enterprises decrease ERP risks, and enhance the chances of success of
   ERP implementations among intra-organizational cultures and
   across-industries. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB The choice of an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) must be made
   judiciously by the high costs involved in the acquisition of such
   systems. Managers in areas such as accounting, financial and information
   technology need support and tools that help in selecting an appropriate
   ERP for their business. With this article, we present a study aimed at
   investigating the possibility of a Decision Support System (DSS) to be
   used for this selection interrelating evaluation criteria, which could
   allow to contemplate the strategic alignment between Business and
   Information Technology. From the literature review 28 factors related to
   the selection of software packages, with special emphasis on ERP were
   identified. For the research procedures, the qualitative ones were
   adopted, in that the 18 factors considered relevant to a good selection
   of ERP were classified with the Delphi technique and used as input in a
   DSS: Analytical Network Process (ANP), applied as a Case Study in a
   small business that hired the ERP. The results showed that the ANP was
   efficient in interrelated criteria and evaluated the strategic alignment
   between Business and Information Technology.

AB Given that prioritization of programmes is a key concern in Local Agenda
   21 processes, the aim of this paper is to explore how the Analytic
   Network Process (ANP) can provide greater consistency and legitimacy to
   prioritization of local action plans. Through the analysis of an
   experience in the municipality of Benetusser in Spain, the study shows
   how ANP, by modelling reality as a network of multiple and mutual
   interrelations, embraces complexity and translates it into a set of
   operational questionnaires that help participants to reflect on their
   preferences and think deeply on the real implications of programmes for
   sustainable development. In the case study, citizens, technical staff
   and politicians of Benetusser carried out the prioritization process by
   defining a set of criteria and assessing the programmes in an
   interrelated way. The experience shows that the ANP procedure not only
   allows prioritization to be dealt with in an organized and systematic
   way, but also enables reflective thinking on sustainable development and
   the role of Local Agenda 21 itself. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley &

   important. Auditors indicate that data access control is very important
   because users have to execute data access every day. Users of IT express
   a preference towards data input/output control as the most important
   control. The results achieved from all experts indicate that the most
   important controls overall are data input/output control, data access
   control and so on. Managers need to consider these risks to avoid any

AB Implementing an enterprise resource planning system is a sophisticated,
   lengthy, and costly process which tends to face serious failure. Thus,
   it is essential to perform a success assessment at the
   post-implementation stage of an ERP project to evaluate how much the
   system has succeeded in achieving its predetermined objectives. This
   paper proposes a practical framework for assessing a firm's ERP
   post-implementation success utilising current models through a fuzzy
   analytic network process. The construct of ERP success is broken down
   into three main parts, including managerial success, organisational
   success, and individual success. Using this framework, the firm's ERP
   system success can be determined and the required improvement projects
   can be proposed to promote the success level. The proposed framework has
   been applied to a real international company, in the field of
   manufacturing and supplying turbines, to measure the firm's ERP
   post-implementation success. Finally, the advantages of the model are
   illustrated.

AB Given significant investments in enterprise resource planning (ERP)
   systems, previous studies report unusually high failure rate and major
   challenges in ERP projects. The activities prior to ERP implementation,
   referred to as the pre-implementation phase, are very important because
   they significantly affect the implementation success. In this paper, the
   pre-implementation phase is focused in which necessary preparations
   before embarking on the ERP initiative, required functions and features,
   and the most appropriate ERP solution are decided. Such decisions are
   risky, costly, and very time-consuming because they necessitate working
   with a vast amount of information and require appropriate analytical
   capabilities as well as decision making methods and structures. In this
   paper, a comprehensive decision support system (DSS) is developed
   helping organisations to make the targeted decisions both efficiently
   and effectively. The proposed framework is applied in a real case study
   to illustrate its effectiveness and practicality.

AB An enterprise resource planning (ERP) system is an information system to
   plan and integrate all of an enterprise's subsystems including purchase,
   production, sales and finance. Adopting such a comprehensive framework
   may result in the great savings in both costs and man hours. This
   research explores the application of a hybrid multicriteria decision
   making (MCDM) procedure for the evaluation of various ERP alternatives.
   The proposed evaluation framework integrates three methodologies:
   Analytic Network Process (ANP), Choquet integral (Cl) and Measuring
   Attractiveness by a Categorical Based Evaluation Technique (MACBETH).
   ANP produces the priorities of alternatives with respect to the
   interdependent evaluation criteria. The conjunctive or disjunctive
   behaviors between criteria are determined using MACBETH and Cl.
   Numerical application of the proposed methodology is implemented on the
   decision making problem of a firm that faces with four ERP projects. The
   final ranking is compared to the one obtained by ignoring the
   interactions among criteria. The results demonstrate that the ignorance
   of the interactions may lead to erroneous decisions. (C) 2012 Elsevier

AB Asus Tech, is the largest motherboard manufacturer in Taiwan. Hundreds
   of suppliers cooperate with the company in business. So that supplier
   selection is the most important function of a purchasing department in
   the enterprise. An enterprise resource planning (ERP) system in the
   process of supplier selection may result in the great savings in both
   costs and man hours. In the concept of push and pull, an ERP system acts
   as an efficient tool in the resource integration and profit creation for
   a company. Through ERP, a decision manager can clearly realize the
   strength and weakness of the purchasing operation. To establish a
   real-time purchasing environment, a methodology of analytic network
   process (ANP), technique for order preference by similarity to ideal
   solution (TOPSIS) and linear programming (LP) are effectively applied in
   the supplier selection process. ANP and TOPSIS are used to calculate the
   weight and give suppliers a ranking; LP effectively allocates order
   quantity to each vendor. As to the result, four PC board suppliers are
   given orders for 1200, 727, 1000 and 73 pieces. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

   Decision making risks, Functional risks. Having "evaluation of the
   failure risk of a SAP/R3 implementation project" as the main objective,
   possible inter and inner relationships/dependencies between the main
   factors are considered and an Analytic Network Process approach is
   proposed to the model. Decision makers usually are unable to be explicit
   about their preferences due to the fuzzy nature of the comparison
   process. So, expert judgments are matched with fuzzy numbers, in this

   at the initial stage of an ERP implementation program to identify
   weaknesses or problems which may lead to project failure. No definite
   practical solution could be found for these kinds of problems in the
   literature. In this paper, a new look at the determinants of a firm's
   readiness to implement an ERP project is presented and using fuzzy
   analytic network process a practical framework is developed. The firm's
   current conditions regarding ERP project can be determined and necessary
   changes prior to implementation of ERP system can be specified. The
   readiness for ERP implementation is decomposed into project management,
   organizational, and change management areas and the assessment factors
   are identified after comprehensive study of critical success factors on
   ERP implementation. The proposed framework is applied to a real case and
   the advantages are illustrated. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB An enterprise resource planning (ERP) software selection is known to be
   multi attribute decision making (MADM) problem. This problem has been
   modeled according with analytic network process (ANP) method due to Tact
   that it considers criteria and sub criteria relations and interrelations
   in selecting the software.
   Opinions of many experts are obtained while building ANP model for the
   selection ERP then opinions arc reduced to one single value by methods
   like geometric means so as to get desired results. To use ANP model for
   the selection of ERP for a new organization, a new group of expert's
   opinions are needed. In this case the same problem will be in counter.
   In the proposed model, when ANP and ANN models are setup, an ERP
   software selection can be made easily by the opinions of one single
   expert. In that case calculation of geometric mean of answers that
   obtained from many experts will be unnecessary. Additionally the effect
   of subjective opinion of one single decision maker will be avoided. In
   terms of difficulty, ANP has some difficulties due to eigenvalue and
   their limit value calculation.
   An ANN model has been designed and trained with using ANP results in
   order to calculate ERP software priority. The artificial neural network
   (ANN) model is trained by results obtained from ANP. It seems that there
   is no any major difficulty in order to predict software priorities with
   trained ANN model. By this results ANN model has been come suitable for
   using in the selection of ERP for another new decision. (C) 2008

AB Objectives: Atrial electrical remodeling is considered to play an
   important role in the appearance of atrial fibrillation. The effect of
   atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) on atrial electrical remodeling was
   evaluated in a canine atrial stimulation model.
   Methods: In 15 beagle dogs, electrodes for pacing and recording were
   fixed on the atrial surface. In 10/15 dogs, rapid atrial stimulation
   (400 bpm) was performed for 7 h at the right atrial appendage (RAA) and
   the remaining 5 were used as the sham without rapid pacing. In 5/ 10
   dogs with rapid pacing, human atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) was
   infused (1.0 mu g/kg/min). The effective refractory period (ERP) and the
   monophasic action potential duration (MAP) were evaluated at 0, 3, and 7
   h after rapid pacing. The expression levels of mRNAs of ion channels or
   transporters were evaluated from the atrial samples of sham and after a
   7 hour pacing.
   Results: In the control group with rapid pacing (n = 5), the atrial ERP
   and MAP duration were shortened at all atrial sites, e. g., ERP from 148
   +/- 14 ms to 109 +/- 8 ms at RAA, P = 0.006. In contrast in the ANP
   group, neither the ERP nor MAP duration showed a significant shortening
   and the effect of ANP on hemodynamic parameter was relatively small.
   Expression levels of the mRNA were not significantly different between
   the control and ANP groups.
   Conclusions: Administration of ANP prevented the shortening of the ERP
   and MAP duration in the rapid atrial stimulation model. The effect of
   ANP on atrial electrical remodeling was considered to be due to its
   direct action on the myocardium. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

AB Assessing ERP system's performance has become an important research
   issue these days. Using a decision analysis such as analytic network
   process (ANP), the  performance evaluation model for ERP System is
   discussed. In this study, the performance variables are identified as
   the perspectives of cost, business process, systems operation, and
   change management, respectively. The empirical study also investigated
   factors that affect the performance variables to find out the causal
   relationship between them using the ANP approach. The data for the
   empirical analysis were collected from manufacturing industries that
   have implemented ERP systems. The result shows that the reduction of
   labour cost, operational expense, and productivity of overall workload
   are crucial factors influencing the success or failure of ERP systems
   among the small & medium-sized companies.

AB During the implementations of enterprise resource planning (ERP)
   systems, most companies have experienced some problems, one of which is
   how to determine the best ERP software satisfying their needs and
   expectations. Because improperly selected ERP software may have an
   impact on the time required, and the costs and market share of a
   company, selecting the best desirable ERP software has been the most
   critical problem for a long time. On the other hand, selecting ERP
   software is a multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem, and in
   the literature, many methods have been introduced to evaluate this kind
   of problem, one of which is the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), which
   has been widely used in MCDM selection problems. However, in this paper,
   we use a fuzzy extension of an analytic network process (ANP), a more
   general form of AHP, which uses uncertain human preferences as input
   information in the decision-making process, because the AHP cannot
   accommodate the variety of interactions, dependencies, and feedback
   between higher- and lower-level elements. Instead of using the classical
   eigenvector prioritization method in the AHP, only employed in the
   prioritization stage of ANP, a fuzzy-logic method providing more
   accuracy on judgements is applied. The resulting fuzzy ANP enhances the
   potential of the conventional ANP for dealing with imprecise and
   uncertain human comparison judgements. In short, in this paper, an
   intelligent approach to ERP software selection through a fuzzy ANP is
   proposed by taking into consideration quantitative and qualitative
   elements to evaluate ERP software alternatives.

AB Despite the possibility of short-term financial losses and concerns by
   executive management of potential failure, enterprise information
   technologies (EITs) are being implemented by a growing number of Fortune
   100 and midsize corporations in the hope of acquiring long-term
   benefits. EITs, expensive and risky information technology assets, must
   be evaluated on the basis of both their productivity gains and their
   support for corporate reengineering through integration of business
   processes. In this paper, we propose a two-stage methodology (involving
   a combination of the analytical network process and integer programming)
   to conduct a high-level evaluation of an interdependent set of tangible,
   intangible, strategic and operational factors that should be considered
   in EIT evaluation. We perform sensitivity analyses and conduct tests
   with real-world data to show the robustness of our methodology and the
   resulting managerial implications.

AB Atrial Electrophysiological Effects of ANP.
   Introduction: Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) may alter
   electrophysiological properties of the heart and possibly have a role in
   arrhythmogenesis. However, previous studies have yielded conflicting
   results and have not fully considered whether ANP's cardiac
   electrophysiological effects are mediated via direct actions and/or
   indirectly via the autonomic nervous system. This study's aim was to
   establish whether ANP infused at pathophysiological and pharmacological
   doses has significant in vivo cardiac electrophysiological effects and
   to determine whether these effects are directly or autonomically
   mediated.
   Methods and Results: Electrophysiologic and hemodynamic effects of ANP
   infusion (human ANP at 15-600 ng/kg per minute) were examined in
   chloralose-anesthetized dogs under conditions of varying autonomic
   blockade. In autonomically intact dogs (n = 12), low-dose ANP (15 ng/kg
   per minute) shortened atrial effective refractory period (ERP) (P <
   0.001) and monophasic action potential duration (MAPD90) (P < 0.05) at
   600, 500, and 400 msec atrial paced cycle lengths and reduced right
   atrial pressure (P < 0.05) but did not alter mean arterial pressure.
   After either combined vagal and beta-adrenergic blockade (vagotomy plus
   atropine plus propranolol, n = 7) or selective vagal blockade (n = 9),
   low-dose ANP no longer altered atrial ERP or MAPD90. Higher ANP doses
   (150 and 600 ng/kg per minute) decreased mean arterial and right atrial
   pressures (P < 0.001) but did not alter atrial ERP, MAPD90, or other
   electrophysiological parameters including atrial fibrillation threshold,
   ventricular ERP, and MAPD90.
   Conclusion: ANP has dose-dependent, autonomically mediated effects on
   atrial refractoriness and repolarization.

AB Corporations are increasingly implementing enterprise information
   technologies (EITs), because of the costs of maintaining legacy systems
   and the lack of fit of such systems for organization-wide information
   sharing. A new type of EIT that is being introduced in major
   corporations (such as Dell Computers), is based on the idea of component
   systems, which are stand-alone software programs that can integrate with
   other such components with relative ease. Given the financial outlay for
   EITs, the evaluation and adoption of these systems is not something that
   can be completed haphazardly. This requirement is complicated by the
   relative infancy of models for the evaluation of componentized EITs. To
   this end, in this paper, we introduce a managerial multistage
   multiattribute decision model, consisting of the Analytical Hierarchy
   Process (AHP) model and the Supermatrix approach (also defined as the
   Analytical Network Processes (ANP) approach). This combination of models
   builds on earlier work that validates the Supermatrix approach for
   evaluating traditional EITs at a Fortune 100 organization. The
   aggregation of these benefits is then measured against the costs of
   systems, thereby arriving at a ranking of alternatives for each
   functional area. We illustrate the model with an example and draw
   managerial implications.
