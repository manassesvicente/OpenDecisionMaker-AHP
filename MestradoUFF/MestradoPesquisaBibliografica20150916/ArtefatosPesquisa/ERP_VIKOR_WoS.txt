AB Qualitative and hesitant information is common in practical decision
   making process. In such complicated decision making problem, it is
   flexible for experts to use comparative linguistic expressions to
   express their opinions since the linguistic expressions are much closer
   than single or simple linguistic term to human way of thinking and
   cognition. The hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS) turns out to
   be a powerful tool in representing and eliciting the comparative
   linguistic expressions. In order to develop some approaches to decision
   making with hesitant fuzzy linguistic information, in this paper, we
   firstly introduce a family of novel distance and similarity measures for
   HFLTSs, such as the cosine distance and similarity measures, the
   weighted cosine distance and similarity measures, the order weighted
   cosine distance and similarity measures, and the continuous cosine
   distance and similarity measures. All these distance and similarity
   measures are proposed from the geometric point of view while the
   existing distance and similarity measures over HFLTSs are based on the
   different forms of algebra distance measures. Afterwards, based on the
   hesitant fuzzy linguistic cosine distance measures between hesitant
   fuzzy linguistic elements, the cosine-distance-based HFL-TOPSIS method
   and the cosine-distance-based HFL-VIKOR method are developed to dealing
   with hesitant fuzzy linguistic multiple criteria decision making
   problems. The step by step algorithms of these two methods are given for
   the convenience of applications. Finally, a numerical example concerning
   the selection of ERP systems is given to illustrate the validation and
   efficiency of the proposed methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Purpose - The purposes of this study were to formulate a hierarchical
   table of factors that influence adoption of an inter-organization system
   (IOS) by enterprises and to apply multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM)
   tools to find the weights of these factors and to objectively identify
   the critical success factors (CSFs) for the adoption of IOSs by
   small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
   Design/methodology/approach - This study first used a literature review
   to collect the factors that affect an enterprise's adoption of an IOS
   and then constructed a three-level hierarchical table of these factors,
   based on a technology - organization - environment framework. Fuzzy
   analytic hierarchy processing was used, based on the returned
   questionnaires, to determine the weights of the factors. The concept of
   VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) acceptable
   advantage was used to objectively identify the CSFs of SMEs that have
   adopted an IOS.
   Findings - This study identifies six CSFs of SMEs that have adopted an
   IOS: industry knowledge and experience, the degree of application of
   information technology within the industry, system safety, the
   organizational infrastructure, customer relationships and ease of use.
   In addition, four findings are proposed.
   Practical implications - The work has studied, in depth, the factors
   that influence the adoption of an IOS by SMEs and identified four
   practice implications that provide a useful guideline for SMEs when they
   plan to adopt an IOS.
   Originality/value - The identification of CSFs is also an MCDM problem.
   However, very few previous articles have used MCDM tools to identify the
   CSFs. This study adopted MCDM tools to objectively identify these CSFs
   and determine their appropriate weights. The results can help the
   managers of SMEs allocate their resources, according to the weighting of
   these CSFs, when they are making plans to adopt an IOS.

AB Software development is an inherently uncertain activity. To deal with
   the uncertainty and vagueness from humans' subjective perception and
   experience in decision process, this paper presents an evaluation model
   based on the fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method for
   measuring the performance of software development projects. In an MCDM
   problem, a decision maker (DM) has to choose the best alternative that
   satisfies the evaluation criteria among a set of candidate solutions. It
   is generally hard to find an alternative that meets all the criteria
   simultaneously, so a good compromise solution is preferred. This problem
   may become more complex when multiple DMs are involved, each having not
   a common perception on the alternatives. Recently, a compromise ranking
   method (known as the VIKOR method) has been proposed to identify such
   compromise solutions, by providing a maximum group utility for the
   majority and a minimum of an individual regret for the opponent. In its
   actual setting, the method treats exact values for the assessment of the
   alternatives, which can be quite restrictive with unquantifiable
   criteria. This will be true especially if the evaluation is made by
   means of linguistic terms. For this reason we extend the VIKOR method so
   as to process such data and to provide a more comprehensive evaluation
   in a fuzzy environment. To demonstrate the potential of the methodology,
   the proposed extension is used for measuring the performance of
   enterprise resource planning (ERP) software products. (C) 2007 IMACS.
