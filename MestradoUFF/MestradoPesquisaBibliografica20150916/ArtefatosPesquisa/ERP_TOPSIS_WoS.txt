AB Qualitative and hesitant information is common in practical decision
   making process. In such complicated decision making problem, it is
   flexible for experts to use comparative linguistic expressions to
   express their opinions since the linguistic expressions are much closer
   than single or simple linguistic term to human way of thinking and
   cognition. The hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS) turns out to
   be a powerful tool in representing and eliciting the comparative
   linguistic expressions. In order to develop some approaches to decision
   making with hesitant fuzzy linguistic information, in this paper, we
   firstly introduce a family of novel distance and similarity measures for
   HFLTSs, such as the cosine distance and similarity measures, the
   weighted cosine distance and similarity measures, the order weighted
   cosine distance and similarity measures, and the continuous cosine
   distance and similarity measures. All these distance and similarity
   measures are proposed from the geometric point of view while the
   existing distance and similarity measures over HFLTSs are based on the
   different forms of algebra distance measures. Afterwards, based on the
   hesitant fuzzy linguistic cosine distance measures between hesitant
   fuzzy linguistic elements, the cosine-distance-based HFL-TOPSIS method
   and the cosine-distance-based HFL-VIKOR method are developed to dealing
   with hesitant fuzzy linguistic multiple criteria decision making
   problems. The step by step algorithms of these two methods are given for
   the convenience of applications. Finally, a numerical example concerning
   the selection of ERP systems is given to illustrate the validation and
   efficiency of the proposed methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Recently, studies about the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) have been
   increased and this research area has attracted more attention.
   Especially, in the global competition environment, enterprises have to
   focus on their Information Systems ( IS) performance to have a
   competitive advantage; implementing an ERP system and improving the
   effectiveness of the system is the only way. However every sector reacts
   to ERP implementation differently. Purpose of this study is to rank the
   sectors according to their performance increments after successful ERP
   implementations by using AHP-TOPSIS hybrid method. As a result, general
   structure of Turkish companies will be pictured and the sectors which
   have the most chance to improve their performance by utilizing an ERP
   system will be defined. These findings will help the companies to plan
   the implementation process more precisely and help the managers of these
   companies to define their expectations more clearly. A numerical example
   is given to clarify the main developed result in this paper.

AB Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems that aim to integrate,
   synchronize and centralize organizational data are generally regarded as
   a vital tool for companies to be successful in the rapidly changing
   global marketplace. Due to its high acquisition purchasing, installation
   and implementation cost and the wide range of offerings, the selection
   of ERP systems is a strategically important and difficult decision.
   Since there is a wide range of tangible and intangible criteria to be
   considered, it is often defined as a multi-criteria decision making
   problem. To overcome the challenges imposed by the multifaceted nature
   of the problem, herein a three-stage hybrid methodology is proposed. The
   process starts with the identification of most prevailing criteria
   through a series of brainstorming sessions that include people from
   different organizational units. Then, due to the varying importance of
   the criteria, a fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process, which handles the
   vagueness inherent in the decision making process, is used to obtain the
   relative importance/weights of the criteria. These weighted criteria are
   then used as input to the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity
   to Ideal Solution method to rank the decision alternatives. As a
   real-world illustrative case, the proposed methodology is applied to the
   ERP selection problem at Turkish Airlines. Because of the collaborative
   and systematic nature of the methodology, the results obtained from the
   process were found to be highly satisfactory and trustworthy by the
   decision makers. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Given significant investments in enterprise resource planning (ERP)
   systems, previous studies report unusually high failure rate and major
   challenges in ERP projects. The activities prior to ERP implementation,
   referred to as the pre-implementation phase, are very important because
   they significantly affect the implementation success. In this paper, the
   pre-implementation phase is focused in which necessary preparations
   before embarking on the ERP initiative, required functions and features,
   and the most appropriate ERP solution are decided. Such decisions are
   risky, costly, and very time-consuming because they necessitate working
   with a vast amount of information and require appropriate analytical
   capabilities as well as decision making methods and structures. In this
   paper, a comprehensive decision support system (DSS) is developed
   helping organisations to make the targeted decisions both efficiently
   and effectively. The proposed framework is applied in a real case study
   to illustrate its effectiveness and practicality.

AB Asus Tech, is the largest motherboard manufacturer in Taiwan. Hundreds
   of suppliers cooperate with the company in business. So that supplier
   selection is the most important function of a purchasing department in
   the enterprise. An enterprise resource planning (ERP) system in the
   process of supplier selection may result in the great savings in both
   costs and man hours. In the concept of push and pull, an ERP system acts
   as an efficient tool in the resource integration and profit creation for
   a company. Through ERP, a decision manager can clearly realize the
   strength and weakness of the purchasing operation. To establish a
   real-time purchasing environment, a methodology of analytic network
   process (ANP), technique for order preference by similarity to ideal
   solution (TOPSIS) and linear programming (LP) are effectively applied in
   the supplier selection process. ANP and TOPSIS are used to calculate the
   weight and give suppliers a ranking; LP effectively allocates order
   quantity to each vendor. As to the result, four PC board suppliers are
   given orders for 1200, 727, 1000 and 73 pieces. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Software development is an inherently uncertain activity. To deal with
   the uncertainty and vagueness from humans' subjective perception and
   experience in decision process, this paper presents an evaluation model
   based on the fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method for
   measuring the performance of software development projects. In an MCDM
   problem, a decision maker (DM) has to choose the best alternative that
   satisfies the evaluation criteria among a set of candidate solutions. It
   is generally hard to find an alternative that meets all the criteria
   simultaneously, so a good compromise solution is preferred. This problem
   may become more complex when multiple DMs are involved, each having not
   a common perception on the alternatives. Recently, a compromise ranking
   method (known as the VIKOR method) has been proposed to identify such
   compromise solutions, by providing a maximum group utility for the
   majority and a minimum of an individual regret for the opponent. In its
   actual setting, the method treats exact values for the assessment of the
   alternatives, which can be quite restrictive with unquantifiable
   criteria. This will be true especially if the evaluation is made by
   means of linguistic terms. For this reason we extend the VIKOR method so
   as to process such data and to provide a more comprehensive evaluation
   in a fuzzy environment. To demonstrate the potential of the methodology,
   the proposed extension is used for measuring the performance of
   enterprise resource planning (ERP) software products. (C) 2007 IMACS.

AB The paper deals with the problem of the redevelopment of derelict
   buildings and abandoned sites as a complex issue that includes
   environmental, social and economic aspects. The objective of the
   research was to suggest a model for determining the rational
   revitalization of derelict immovable property from the perspective of
   sustainable development. The authors assume that a multi-criterion
   analysis is an appropriate technique to use to assure equilibrium among
   various domains of sustainability. When taking into account the
   uncertainty of a problem, calculations using the fuzzy version of the
   TOPSIS method were proposed. The development of a model for determining
   revitalization priorities of abandoned buildings was based on a case
   study of derelict rural buildings in Lithuania. A set of indicators was
   defined and used to perform the multi-criterion analysis of
   revitalization alternatives of the derelict buildings. Based on results
   from calculations, scientific recommendations for a rational
   revitalization of buildings and their sites were prepared. Copyright (c)
