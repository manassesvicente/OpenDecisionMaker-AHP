AB In addressing integration issues, service-oriented architecture (SOA)
   has emerged and been adopted by banks, but many of them have failed to
   achieve significant SOA benefits. An important reason for this failure
   is attributed to the absence of a methodological framework that explains
   factors influencing SOA adoption in e-banking. In addition to this, the
   normative literature reports that differences may exist between
   organizations from developed and transition economies when they adopt
   integration technologies. Thus, the aim of this paper is to (a) propose
   a methodological framework for SOA adoption, (b) test it through case
   studies conducted in a developed and a transition economy, and (c)
   investigate differences and similarities among these two types of
   economies. The findings verify our framework and suggest some additions
   to it as there are new factors that were observed during the case
   studies like SOA governance. Our study also reveals similarities and
   differences, like the level of attention between case organizations from
   a developed and transition economy. This paper extends the body of
   knowledge and allows us to better understand the adoption practices of
   the organizations from developed and transition economies. The paper
   also provides new insights related to factors affecting SOA adoption in
   e-banking.

AB The emergence of innovative and revolutionary Integration Technologies
   (IntTech) has highly influenced the local government authorities (LGAs)
   in their decision-making process. LGAs that plan to adopt such IntTech
   may consider this as a serious investment. Advocates, however, claim
   that such IntTech have emerged to overcome the integration problems at
   all levels (e.g. data, object and process). With the emergence of
   electronic government (e-Government), LGAs have turned to IntTech to
   fully automate and offer their services on-line and integrate their IT
   infrastructures. While earlier research on the adoption of IntTech has
   considered several factors (e.g. pressure, technological, support, and
   financial), inadequate attention and resources have been applied in
   systematically investigating the individual, decision and organisational
   context factors, influencing top management's decisions for adopting
   IntTech in LGAs. It is a highly considered phenomenon that the success
   of an organisation's operations relies heavily on understanding an
   individual's attitudes and behaviours, the surrounding context and the
   type of decisions taken. Based on empirical evidence gathered through
   two intensive case studies, this paper attempts to investigate the
   factors that influence decision makers while adopting IntTech. The
   findings illustrate two different doctrines one inclined and receptive
   towards taking risky decisions, the other disinclined. Several
   underlying rationales can be attributed to such mind-sets in LGAs. The
   authors aim to contribute to the body of knowledge by exploring the
   factors influencing top management's decision-making process while
   adopting IntTech vital for facilitating LGAs' operational reforms. (C)

AB The demand and support for enterprise applications integration (EAI) in
   Nigeria was investigated. The findings show that the demand and support
   for EAI are driven by a number of factors, including concern for
   data/information integration, a common interface for all enterprise
   applications, improved communication and faster data transfer, real-time
   data capture and access to information across various networks, as well
   as data and information integrity across various systems. The IT
   companies in Nigeria are following the progress of technology and are
   poised to respond to it in their approaches to EAI solutions. Their
   future approaches will be influenced to the greatest extent by progress
   in Graphical User Interface (GUI) and then by developments in Enterprise
   Resource Planning (ERP), Operating Systems, Software as a Service
   (SaaS), Parameterization of applications for easy customization,
   Applications Service Provision, and Open Source Systems in that order.
   They believe that Nigeria has the greatest capacity in Software as a
   Service (SaaS) and Software as Secured Service (SaSS). A growing number
   of companies are using open source tools in developing and implementing
   EAI solutions, and this is an indication of a market that is taking on
   its own character but also a subscription to the democratization of
   software access. The popularity of SQL Server and its varieties, closely
   followed by Oracle and Java/Javascript, as EAI tools in Nigeria is
   probably a reflection of their prominence on the international scene.

AB Population growth and the environment is now a major discussion issue.
   Most cases of excessive preference for a larger family size are involved
   with environmental degradation in developing countries. Moreover, rural
   or indigenous people living in forest areas have a regular interaction
   with the environment. They usually depend on environmental resources for
   subsistence. The main objective of this study is to analyze indigenous
   people's perception of the relationship between environment and
   fertility. Out of the seven Khasia villages, the village called
   Lawachora Punji, with 23 households, was included in the field survey.
   The research findings reveal that environmental awareness is higher
   among women and the overall index is relatively low in the indigenous
   people regarding the environmental and demographic aspects. The overall
   environmental awareness index (EAI) indicates that people living in
   Lawachora National Park do not have a strong understanding of the impact
   of large family size on the environment. Grassroots level participation
   and gradual change of perception of large family size and dependence on
   forest resources are important to environmental sustainability in
   developing countries. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP

AB Enterprises tend to depend on various legacy applications in supporting
   their business strategies and in achieving their goals. In order for an
   enterprise to be efficient and cost-effective, their legacy applications
   should be seamlessly integrated within and beyond the enterprise. Some
   research work in enterprise applications integrations (EAI) analyzed the
   problem, while others proposed solution models for the syntactic and
   semantic integration of business processes. In this paper, the EAI is
   considered as a design problem and is analyzed from design point of
   view. Environment based design (EBD) methodology is applied to handle
   the integration problem by analyzing and clarifying the design
   requirements to generate appropriate solutions. A framework is proposed
   for EAI problems based on the EBD approach. A case study is also
   provided to show how the approach can be applied within a company to
   generate satisfactory EAI solutions with low cost, high efficiency, and
   enhanced scalability. [DOI: 10.1115/1.4007171]

   in France, reports findings on how SMEs architect to achieve IS
   integration and interoperability. This research provides an empirically
   derived taxonomy of enterprise architectural variants of the types often
   described in the literature for large firms. This study finds
   indications that for SMEs the immediate goal of interoperability
   prevailed over fuller and more formal system integration. The most
   common means for approaching enterprise architecture and any form of
   integration is via the construction of software bridges and interfaces.
   Partially standardized architectures based on Enterprise Systems (ERP)
   are the next most common type. Hybrid architectures mixed Enterprise
   Applications Integration and ERP are the third most common. The
   contribution of this paper lies not in the identification of the three
   types but resides (1) in the description of their distribution in SMEs;
   (2) in the absence of other integration/interoperability types in this
   population; and (3) most importantly in the interpretation of the
   organizational and historical rationale explaining the emergence of
   these types in this organizational context. European Journal of

   with internal processes as well as suppliers and customers. This
   phenomenon indicates that EB systems are playing an important role in
   attaining the effectiveness of enterprise operations. However, there is
   a constant complaint from recruiters that EB professionals with the
   right skills are hard to come by. To gauge the rapid changes in EB
   education and industry demand, EB curricula from top universities and
   job announcements from popular career Web sites in both the US and
   Taiwan are collected. We analyze the data and compare the results
   between the two countries to recommend remedial actions for narrowing
   the gap between industry and academia. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB The design of large and complex enterprise integration solutions is a
   difficult task. It can require solutions that are unique because of
   constraints from the current set of legacy applications. Design
   knowledge for enterprise integration solutions is, therefore, difficult
   to articulate and reuse. In particular, the nature and form of knowledge
   for conceptual design of integration solutions is difficult to pin down.
   In this paper, we investigate whether design knowledge for enterprise
   integration in the form of patterns can be reused to develop systems
   integration solutions, and whether such reuse leads to more effective
   design outcomes. The research follows design science guidelines in which
   we describe a research artifact, and evaluate it to assess whether it
   meets the intended goals. The results indicate that approaches to
   facilitate reuse of conceptual design knowledge are feasible in the
   domain of enterprise integration, and that such reuse does, in fact,
   lead to more effective design solutions.

AB Due to the rapidly changing business and IT environments, firm-level
   adoption of IT shifted from in-house development to purchasing EA
   software. This paper analyzes the effects of EA (Enterprise Application)
   software - ERP, CRM, SCM, Groupware, KM, EAI - on SMEs' productivity.
   The distinct feature of this paper is that I use a formal econometric
   approach with combined data of SMEs' accounting and IT usage aspects,
   while case studies have been mostly used in the previous works. The
   empirical results show that Groupware and SCM significantly raise the
   SMEs' productivity, and the manufacturing sector has stronger effects
   than the service sector. From these results, the following implications
   are derived. First, the adoption rate and the real benefits of EA
   software are not closely related domestically. Second, in SMEs, EA
   software facilitating the inter-firm relationship is more effective than
   EA software focusing on the internal efficiency. Third,
   easy-to-understand, and relatively long-experienced enterprise
   applications are more effective than hard-to-understand and brand-new
   applications. Finally, the government IT policy on SMEs should focus on
   the process coordination and standardization of the manufacturing sector
   with upstream and downstream firms.

   In realising this, it has forced businesses to acknowledge the need to
   integrate ERP systems with existing disparate legacy systems. Technology
   solutions such as Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) have been
   seen as a panacea to facilitate integration through the use of
   technologies that allow corporate IS subsystems to communicate with one
   another. In the context of using enterprise technologies to integrate
   ERP with other organisational business systems, this paper analyses and
   extends previously published work through presenting the failure of an
   industrial automation business to integrate its ERP system with legacy
   processes when using an EAI approach. In doing so, the authors present a
   post hoc evaluation model that can be used by others as a frame of
   reference; a tool for reflection. The presented model seeks to provide
   further insight to the failed approach to ERP integration, within the
   given case study organisation. This proposed model, is constructed in
   terms of Technical, Organisational and Tailorability components. It is
   anticipated that this will be a useful tool for both practitioners and
   academics, who wish to gain a deeper understanding of ERP/EAI
   implementation approaches, as well as providing insights into how the
   componentisation and extension of ERP functionalities can be achieved,
   towards so-called ERPII.

AB This paper investigates Critical Success Factors (CSFs) in Enterprise
   Application Integration (EAI). An initial set of CSFs for EAI projects
   was created based on a review and synthesis of the literature in the
   general area of integration, including Enterprise Resource Planning
   (ERP) projects. A case analysis, involving a large financial services
   provider integrating its consumer banking systems, was used to validate
   the CSFs. The findings resulted in a more structured and holistic CSF
   model which identifies three broad groups of CSFs, namely ( 1) top
   management support, ( 2) overall integration strategy, and ( 3) EAI
   project planning and execution. Although EAI projects share many of the
   same CSFs as ERP projects and other information systems projects, issues
   related to the selection of the right EAI tool and emphasis on
   technology planning and enterprise architecture are distinguishing
   features of EAI projects. Some of practical implications of the research
   are that EAI projects require personnel with specific skills and
   expertise, business integration should precede technology integration,
   that availability of adapters is an important criteria in EAI tool
   selection and that some custom adapter development may be unavoidable if
   custom applications need to be integrated.

AB Purpose - To review the development of software applications and their
   functionalities/benefits in relation to supply chain management and
   present scenarios on future development.
   Design/methodology/approach - A range of recently published academic and
   non-academic pieces of work that can be classified as pertinent to the
   area in question. These sources employ both theoretical and practical
   views on the topic of supply chain co-ordination software and related
   functionalities and resulted benefits.
   Findings - There is a significant overlap regarding the functionalities
   of software applications and the trend of convergence is about to
   intensify. At the same time the need for real time information will
   become crucial, putting emphasis on flexible IT-systems that can deal
   with large amounts of data and are easy to interconnect. In turn this
   will lead to the growing importance of system integration software and
   the process of creating standards.
   Research limitations/implications - As a result of continuous
   development and convergence of IT-solutions and turbulent business
   environment more applied research will be needed in the area of product
   configuration, RFID-technology, standards in relation to
   interoperability of software applications (EAI technologies). This
   scrutiny is based only on written resources and no consultants or
   manager interviews were employed. Therefore the views of companies are
   not presented on the issues covered.
   Practical implications - The selection of the appropriate software
   solutions for a company will need more time, expertise and money and the
   role of suppliers of software packages will become more significant.
   Originality/value - This scrutiny stipulates the way the functionalities
   of software applications evolve with overlap one another and thus helps
   both researchers and companies to gain a clearer view on the development
   of supply chain software applications.

AB Economy of scale would be one of the most important issues among
   organizations pursuing system integration projects. Cerntainly there are
   other benefits than cost reduction for achieving system integration.
   However, these benefits could not be achieved automatically, if system
   integration projects were undertaken without thoughtful planning.In this
   paper, we propose a framework for an effective system integration by (1)
   defining the objects(user interface, database, application, and server)
   and (2) considering the level of integration(physical integration and
   rational integration). Therefore, 6 types of integration can be
   considered. Five case studies of domestic organizaions were reviewed to
   suggest various issues and solutions. Based on our case studies, we
   discovered that five integration types - EIP, EAI, ERP, BPM and System
   Reconsolidation - were most widely used.

AB Many of previous works proposed a revolution map of supply chain
   integration through information systems integration of supply chain
   members. Followed by implementation of Enterprise Resource Planning(ERP)
   systems, more recently, firms are trying to integrate various and
   separate information systems of their supply chain members. In this
   regards, inter-organization system(IOS) development and Enterprise
   Application Integration(EAI) have received more attentions from academic
   and industry area. In this study, we chose a company, which implemented
   web-based service to integrate their distribution channel; and, analyzed
   in order to validate previous works.   From an exploratory case
   analysis, we came up with validations for determinant set, critical
   success factors in IOS and post-implementation effects of IOS.

   for and opportunities provided by integration concepts and draw
   conclusions about what integrated environments and enterprise resource
   planning systems can contribute in terms of serving as a sound and
   future proof basis for mobile and ubiquitous use of technology. Some of
   the research issues identified are, not astonishing at all, pointing
   back to open questions already encountered in database and artificial
   intelligence projects in past decades. Thanks to the advances of
   information technology some answers can now be given.

AB To support the purchasing process in the B2B EC platform, we analyzed
   various architectures of buyer-carts. The desired features in
   buyer-carts are collection, recording, trashing, tracking,
   identification, ordering, payment, purchasing decision support, and
   transmission of records to e-procurement systems. A buyer-cart can be
   categorized as s-cart, i-cart, and b-cart depending upon its residing
   sites: seller, intermediary, and buyer. To design the architectures of
   B2B e-marketplaces considering the role of buyer-carts, we analyzed the
   feasible combinations of marketplace operators, pricing mechanisms, and
   types of buyer-carts. Seventeen elementary types of B2B EC architectures
   turned out meaningful in this regard, thus their pros and cons are
   evaluated. Based on this framework, we designed a composite architecture
   MyCart, which allows the buyer to use b-cart along with s-cart and
   i-cart. By using the b-cart, a buyer can visit multiple sites collecting
   information in his or her own cart. This will allow the tight
   integration of b-cart with the e-procurement system. We demonstrate that
   the b-cart approach can be an effective framework of integrating the
   e-marketplaces with e-procurement systems and ERP systems. The b-cart
   can be very effectively applied to the desktop purchasing environment
   which uses external e-marketplaces.

   techniques is discussed exemplarily for a university hospital, the
   Universitatsklinikum Leipzig (UKL) in Germany. The integration of the
   central patient management system serving the administrative department
   with the clinical workplace systems serving hospital wards is presented.
   We analyze the integration with respect to the underlying theoretical
   conceptions and discuss information management issues for deployment and
   maintenance of the overall IT infrastructure. This paper presents the
   pros and cons of synchronous and asynchronous patient data replication,
   the practical experience with the deployment of a communication server,
   and the experience with using an RFC interface, a proprietary interface
   to the enterprise resource planning system SAP R/3. Both, organizational
   and technical issues are addressed in this context.

AB Data dictionary is a collection of meta-data, which describes data
   produced and consumed while performing business processes. Data
   dictionary is an essential element for business process standardization
   and automation, and has a fundamental role in ERP application management
   and customization. Also, data dictionary facilitates B2B processes by
   enabling painless integration of business processes between various
   enterprises. We implemented data dictionary support in SEA+, a
   component-based scalable ERP system developed in ETRI, and found out
   that its a plausible feature of business information system. We
   discovered that data dictionary promotes semantic, not syntactic, data
   management, which can make it possible to leverage viability of the tool
   in the coming age of more meta-data oriented computing world. We
   envision that business data dictionary is a firm foundation of adapting
   business knowledge, applications and processes into the semantic web
   based enterprise infra-structure.
