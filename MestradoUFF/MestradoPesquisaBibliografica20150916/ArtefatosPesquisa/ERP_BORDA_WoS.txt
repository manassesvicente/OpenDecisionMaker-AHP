AB The main objectives of this study were to diagnose the current
   environmental scenery and a legal scenery for the Buffer Zone (BZ) of
   the State Park of Porto Ferreira (SPPF), and propose a discussion of BZs
   and their planning. We conducted a mapping of the land use and
   occupation and calculated landscape metrics. The predominant class use
   in the BZ was sugarcane, with 46.24%, and forest class was the third,
   with the largest coverage, 12.7%. Landscape metrics indicated that the
   natural vegetation of the BZ has 83.3% of fragments up to 10ha, and 50%
   of them showed a very low connectivity. The PPA totalized 386ha, 39% of
   it has natural vegetation. As for the legal scenery, with all the PPA
   preserved, there would be an increase of 239ha of natural vegetation and
   a reduction of fragments from 60 to 27, thus showing larger and more
   connected fragments. The low percentage of forest, low connectivity
   between fragments and the non-compliance with environmental legislation
   in the BZ contribute to isolation of the conservation unit and the
   increase of edge effects, generating impacts on the biodiversity of the
   SPPF.

TI LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION AND CONFIGURATION OF JACARE STREAM SUB-BASIN,
   TAQUARI VALLEY, RS, WITH EMPHASIS ON THE FOREST AREAS

AB The conversion of continuous forest coverage areas into forest fragments
   has contributed to the decrease of the biological diversity due to the
   micro-habitat loss, changes in dispersion and migration patterns,
   habitats' isolation and soil erosion. The solution for those problems is
   intimately linked to the planning and maintenance of hydrographic
   basins. Jacare's stream sub-basin is located in Taquari Valley, RS, with
   an area of 538,98 km(2), where nine municipal districts are partially or
   totally inserted. This basin is in an ecotone area among the plant
   formations Deciduous Seasonal Forest (DSF) and Mixed Ombrophila Forest -
   Araucaria Forest (MOF). Information related to the structural
   characteristics of the existent forest classes in the area (DSF, MOF and
   secondary growth vegetation) was elaborated and analyzed using images
   from the satellite Landsat 7 ETM(+), passage 04/02/2002 and Geographical
   Information Systems (GIS) Idrisi 3.2 and Landscape Ecology Fragstats 3.3
   software systems. The results indicate that the area presents
   approximately 52% of native forests that are preserved or in
   regeneration process, but in a highly fragmented way, with 87,82% of the
   fragments smaller than 1ha. Considering a border effect of 50m, around
   40% of the fragments still present a nuclear area.
