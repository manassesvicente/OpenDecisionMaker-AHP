AB  - We integrated five indicator indices viz., wildlife distribution index (WDI), ecological value index (EVI), ecotourism attractivity index (EAI), environmental resiliency index (ERI), ecotourism diversity index (EDI) to identify and prioritize the potential ecotourism sites in West District of Sikkim state in India. The primary variables used for generating various indices were landform, elevation, land use/forest cover, vegetation diversity, density and endemism, wildlife (mainly birds and butterflies), tourism attraction features and the infrastructure facilities. Data and information from remote sensing and other sources were used. The analytical hierarchical process and geographic information system were effectively used for identification of the potential ecotourism sites (PES). Â© International Society for Tropical Ecology.

AB  - Purpose: The application of enterprise application integration (EAI) technologies in integrating heterogeneous information systems (IS) has been pursued by several private and public organisations. However, where EAI has added effectiveness and strengthened the information technology infrastructures in the private domain, local government authorities (LGAs) have been slow in adopting cost-effective EAI solutions to significantly expand the capabilities of their conventionally inflexible IS. Despite EAI represents an attractive proposition to LGAs and offers the opportunity to leverage the IS into a seamless chain of processes, EAI has not been widely investigated in LGAs. Literature indicates several research studies mainly focusing on a number of different factors (e.g. benefits, barriers) influencing EAI adoption. However, due to plethora of different factors, it may not be sufficient for LGAs to take decisions by merely focusing on factors. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to assess and prioritise the factors influencing EAI adoption in LGAs through the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) technique. Design/methodology/approach: To investigate the less acknowledged phenomena like EAI adoption in LGAs, the author follows an interpretive, qualitative case study approach to conduct this research. This approach will assist in examining the phenomenon in its natural setting, examine the in-depth complexities and processes, e.g. analysing and prioritising the importance of factors influencing the decision-making process for EAI adoption, and provide considerable flexibility during interviews and observations. Findings: According to the empirical findings, the proposed EAI adoption factors are appropriate for studying the research context. The analysis and study of the factors is made carefully and specifically to fit and be compatible within the context of an LGA. As a result, it is apparent from the empirical findings that most of the factors have influenced the decision-making process for EAI adoption except two factors that are not tested. Originality/value: The author takes into consideration the literature void and prioritise the importance the factors by introducing the AHP technique. This technique is substantial as it may enhance the analysis of EAI adoption in LGAs, tests and justifies the feasibility of AHP technique by a case study, and facilitates LGAs in realising the importance of EAI adoption factors. Hence, it significantly contributes to the body of knowledge and practice in this area and providing sufficient support to the management by speeding up the EAI adoption process.
