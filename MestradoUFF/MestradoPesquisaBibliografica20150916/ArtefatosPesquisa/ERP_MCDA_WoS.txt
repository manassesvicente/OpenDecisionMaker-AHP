AB Business intelligence (BI) has been recognized as an important
   enterprise information system to help decision makers achieve
   performance measurement and management. Generally, typical BI users
   consist of financial analysts, marketing planners, and general managers.
   However, most of them are not familiar with BI's core technologies. In
   order to help corporate executives better assess BI vendors, evaluation
   criteria are separated into marketing requirements (MRs) and technical
   attributes (TM), respectively. In particular, a fuzzy MCDM
   (multi-criteria decision making) based QFD (quality function deployment)
   is proposed as follows: (1) fuzzy Delphi is used to aggregate the
   performance scores of BI vendors, (2) fuzzy DEMATEL (decision making and
   trial laboratory) is conducted to recognize the causalities between MRs
   and TAs, and (3) fuzzy AHP (analytical hierarchy process) is employed to
   recommend optimal BI systems. For better benchmarking, the strengths and
   weaknesses of three competitive BI vendors (i.e. SAP, SAS, and
   Microsoft) are concurrently visualized through displaying a line diagram
   (in terms of TM) and a radar diagram (in terms of MRs). More
   importantly, experimental results demonstrate that supplier assessment
   and supplier recommendation have been successfully accomplished. (C)

AB Maintaining information in visual working memory is reliably indexed by
   the contralateral delay activity (CDA) - a sustained modulation of the
   event-related potential (ERP) with a topographical maximum over
   posterior scalp regions contralateral to the memorized input. Based on
   scalp topography, it is hypothesized that the CDA reflects neural
   activity in the parietal cortex, but the precise cortical origin of
   underlying electric activity was never determined. Here we combine ERP
   recordings with magnetoencephalography based source localization to
   characterize the cortical current sources generating the CDA. Observers
   performed a cued delayed match to sample task where either the color or
   the relative position of colored dots had to be maintained in memory. A
   detailed source-localization analysis of the magnetic activity in the
   retention interval revealed that the magnetic analog of the CDA (mCDA)
   is generated by current sources in the parietal cortex. Importantly, we
   find that the mCDA also receives contribution from current sources in
   the ventral extrastriate cortex that display a time-course similar to
   the parietal sources. On the basis of the magnetic responses, forward
   modeling of ERP data reveals that the ventral sources have non-optimal
   projections and that these sources are therefore concealed in the ERP by
   overlapping fields with parietal projections. The present observations
   indicate that visual working memory maintenance, as indexed by the CDA,
   involves the parietal cortical regions as well as the ventral
   extrastriate regions, which code the sensory representation of the
   memorized content. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, which integrates all of the
   units within an organization at the information level, plays an
   important role for a successful enterprise. With the right ERP system,
   it is easier to provide coordination.between the units, eliminate waste
   and make faster and better decisions. Adopting an ERP system is a
   significant investment decision for a firm, therefore a great deal of
   attention should be given to the selection of the right system. Since
   there are a large number of criteria to consider in selecting an ERP
   system, the process itself is regarded as a complex multi-criteria
   decision making problem. In this study, two prevalent multi-criteria
   decision making techniques, Analytic Network Process (ANP) and
   Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations
   (PROMETHEE), are used in combination to better address the ERP selection
   problem. First, ANP is used to determine the weights of all criteria,
   and then, the obtained weights are used in the PROMETHEE method for
   optimal ranking of the alternative system choices. To demonstrate the
   viability of the proposed methodology, an application case is performed
   on the ERP selection problem for the Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in
   Istanbul, Turkey. The proposed hybrid methodology successfully ranked
   the alternatives and identified the best ERP system based on the
   information obtained from a number of SMEs participated in this study.

AB The aim of this paper was to evaluate the risk level for both
   intra-organizational cultures and for different industries in
   implementing an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. This study
   adopts the Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (FANP) method to assess ERP
   implementation risks, which were categorized into four dimensions:
   management and execution, software system, users, and technology
   planning. An empirical survey was conducted that utilized the collected
   survey data of 20 ERP experts in Taiwan to assess, rank, and improve the
   critical risks of ERP implementation via the FANP method. Based on the
   results of the FANP method, a follow-up survey of ERP end-users in
   different departments of three industries was conducted to assess how
   intra-organizational cultures and cross-industries affect users'
   perceived risks a real world scenario. Our research results demonstrated
   that "lack of management support and assistance" is vital risk for a
   successful ERP implementation. Top management support and involvement
   are crucial and essential factors to the success of a firm's ERP
   implementation. "Ineffective communication with users" was found to be
   the second highest risk factor. The benefits of using the FANP method
   for evaluating the risk factors come from the clear priority weights
   between alternatives. Finally, this study provides suggestions to help
   enterprises decrease ERP risks, and enhance the chances of success of
   ERP implementations among intra-organizational cultures and
   across-industries. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

   are developed to support various processes of enterprises. ERP
   (Enterprise Resource Planning) has been a leading EIS (Enterprise
   Information Systems) application and companies are allocating resources
   to such new projects. However, studies report that most of the projects
   fail or cannot reach the desired outcomes selecting inappropriate
   software is represented as one of the major sources for project
   failures. This paper focuses on EIS selection problem which is a
   multicriteria decision making (MCDM) problem since it contains various
   and conflicting criteria. In this study, a group decision making
   approach using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Interval type-2
   fuzzy sets is used on a real world ERP selection problem with six
   criteria and four alternatives. The originality of the study comes from
   using interval type-2 fuzzy sets in the decision problem. By using
   interval type-2 fuzzy sets for handling fuzzy group decision-making
   problems more flexible decisions can be given since interval type-2
   fuzzy sets are more suitable to represent uncertainties than type-1
   fuzzy set.

AB Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems that aim to integrate,
   synchronize and centralize organizational data are generally regarded as
   a vital tool for companies to be successful in the rapidly changing
   global marketplace. Due to its high acquisition purchasing, installation
   and implementation cost and the wide range of offerings, the selection
   of ERP systems is a strategically important and difficult decision.
   Since there is a wide range of tangible and intangible criteria to be
   considered, it is often defined as a multi-criteria decision making
   problem. To overcome the challenges imposed by the multifaceted nature
   of the problem, herein a three-stage hybrid methodology is proposed. The
   process starts with the identification of most prevailing criteria
   through a series of brainstorming sessions that include people from
   different organizational units. Then, due to the varying importance of
   the criteria, a fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process, which handles the
   vagueness inherent in the decision making process, is used to obtain the
   relative importance/weights of the criteria. These weighted criteria are
   then used as input to the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity
   to Ideal Solution method to rank the decision alternatives. As a
   real-world illustrative case, the proposed methodology is applied to the
   ERP selection problem at Turkish Airlines. Because of the collaborative
   and systematic nature of the methodology, the results obtained from the
   process were found to be highly satisfactory and trustworthy by the
   decision makers. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose - The purposes of this study were to formulate a hierarchical
   table of factors that influence adoption of an inter-organization system
   (IOS) by enterprises and to apply multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM)
   tools to find the weights of these factors and to objectively identify
   the critical success factors (CSFs) for the adoption of IOSs by
   small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
   Design/methodology/approach - This study first used a literature review
   to collect the factors that affect an enterprise's adoption of an IOS
   and then constructed a three-level hierarchical table of these factors,
   based on a technology - organization - environment framework. Fuzzy
   analytic hierarchy processing was used, based on the returned
   questionnaires, to determine the weights of the factors. The concept of
   VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) acceptable
   advantage was used to objectively identify the CSFs of SMEs that have
   adopted an IOS.
   Findings - This study identifies six CSFs of SMEs that have adopted an
   IOS: industry knowledge and experience, the degree of application of
   information technology within the industry, system safety, the
   organizational infrastructure, customer relationships and ease of use.
   In addition, four findings are proposed.
   Practical implications - The work has studied, in depth, the factors
   that influence the adoption of an IOS by SMEs and identified four
   practice implications that provide a useful guideline for SMEs when they
   plan to adopt an IOS.
   Originality/value - The identification of CSFs is also an MCDM problem.
   However, very few previous articles have used MCDM tools to identify the
   CSFs. This study adopted MCDM tools to objectively identify these CSFs
   and determine their appropriate weights. The results can help the
   managers of SMEs allocate their resources, according to the weighting of
   these CSFs, when they are making plans to adopt an IOS.

AB Cloud computing delivers almost all of its services including software,
   user's data, system resources, processes and their computation over the
   Internet. Cloud computing consists of three main classes; Software as a
   Service, Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as a Service. Using
   Software as a Service (SaaS), users are able to rent application
   software and databases which they then install onto their computer in
   the traditional way. In the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system,
   the system service environment changed so as to allow the application of
   the SaaS in the cloud computing environment. This change was implemented
   in order to provide the ERP system service to users in a cheaper, more
   convenient and efficient form through the Internet as opposed to having
   to set up their own computer. Recently many SaaS ERP packages are
   available on the Internet. For this reason, it is very difficult for
   users to find the SaaS ERP package that would best suit their
   requirements. The QoS (Quality of Service) model can provide a solution
   to this problem. However, according to recent research, not only quality
   attributes' identification for SaaS ERP, but also a process for finding
   and recommending software in the cloud computing environment, has proved
   to be lacking. In this paper, we propose a QoS model for SaaS ERP. The
   proposed QoS model consists of 6 criteria; Functionality, Reliability,
   Usability, Efficiency, Maintainability and Business. Using this QoS
   model, we propose a Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) system that
   finds the best fit for the SaaS ERP in the cloud computing environment
   and makes recommendations to users in priority order. In order to
   organize the quality clusters, we organized an expert group and got
   their opinion to organize the quality clusters using Social Network
   Group. Social Networks can be used efficiently to get opinion by various
   types of expert groups. In order to establish the priority, we used
   pairwise comparisons to calculate the priority weights of each quality
   attribute while accounting for their interrelation. Finally, using the
   quality network model and priority weights, this study evaluated three
   types of SaaS ERPs. Our results show how to find the most suitable SaaS
   ERPs according to their correlation with the criteria and to recommend a
   SaaS ERP package which best suits users' needs.

AB Given that prioritization of programmes is a key concern in Local Agenda
   21 processes, the aim of this paper is to explore how the Analytic
   Network Process (ANP) can provide greater consistency and legitimacy to
   prioritization of local action plans. Through the analysis of an
   experience in the municipality of Benetusser in Spain, the study shows
   how ANP, by modelling reality as a network of multiple and mutual
   interrelations, embraces complexity and translates it into a set of
   operational questionnaires that help participants to reflect on their
   preferences and think deeply on the real implications of programmes for
   sustainable development. In the case study, citizens, technical staff
   and politicians of Benetusser carried out the prioritization process by
   defining a set of criteria and assessing the programmes in an
   interrelated way. The experience shows that the ANP procedure not only
   allows prioritization to be dealt with in an organized and systematic
   way, but also enables reflective thinking on sustainable development and
   the role of Local Agenda 21 itself. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley &

AB An enterprise resource planning (ERP) system is an information system to
   plan and integrate all of an enterprise's subsystems including purchase,
   production, sales and finance. Adopting such a comprehensive framework
   may result in the great savings in both costs and man hours. This
   research explores the application of a hybrid multicriteria decision
   making (MCDM) procedure for the evaluation of various ERP alternatives.
   The proposed evaluation framework integrates three methodologies:
   Analytic Network Process (ANP), Choquet integral (Cl) and Measuring
   Attractiveness by a Categorical Based Evaluation Technique (MACBETH).
   ANP produces the priorities of alternatives with respect to the
   interdependent evaluation criteria. The conjunctive or disjunctive
   behaviors between criteria are determined using MACBETH and Cl.
   Numerical application of the proposed methodology is implemented on the
   decision making problem of a firm that faces with four ERP projects. The
   final ranking is compared to the one obtained by ignoring the
   interactions among criteria. The results demonstrate that the ignorance
   of the interactions may lead to erroneous decisions. (C) 2012 Elsevier

   well as identify the actions necessary before implementing ERP. The
   subjectivity and vagueness in the prediction procedures are dealt with
   linguistic variables quantified in an interval [-t, t]. Then predicted
   success/failure values are obtained to enable organizations to decide
   whether to initiate ERP, inhibit adoption or take remedial actions to
   increase the success possibility of ERP. Pairwise comparisons are used
   to determine the priority weights of influential factors, and the
   possible occurrence ratings of success or failure outcome amongst
   decision makers. There are not any inconsistency occurred in this
   procedures because this proposed approach allows every decision expert
   to choose an explicit criterion or alternative for the without
   restriction. When there are n criteria in a decision matrix, only n - 1
   times of pairwise comparisons are taken. This approach not only improves
   the efficiency of pairwise comparison compared with the traditional AHP,
   but also avoids the checking the consistency of linguistic preference
   relation when the decision makers undertake the pairwise comparison

AB Outsourcing can be seen as a strategic way to align technology
   initiatives and business goals, as a strategy for managing technology
   operations in today's difficult business environment, and as a way to
   reduce operating costs. Often, companies begin the process by
   outsourcing non-core business operations, which may include
   applications, assets, people and other resources. The outsourcing
   decision is important since the correct selection can dramatically
   increase a firm's performance. When companies outsource a significant
   part of their business and become more dependent on outsourcers, the
   consequences of poor decision making becomes more severe. Since
   enterprise resource planning (ERP) is one of the vital systems, if not
   the one, that integrates all functions including planning,
   manufacturing, distribution, and accounting into a single system, its
   outsourcing is a very important multi-attribute decision problem for the
   firms. In the literature, outsourcing decisions are often based on
   multi-criteria approaches. In this paper, a fuzzy multi-criteria
   decision making methodology is suggested for the selection among ERP
   outsourcing alternatives. The methodology is based on the analytic
   hierarchy process (AHP) under fuzziness. It allows decision-makers to
   express their evaluations in linguistic expressions, crisp or fuzzy
   numbers. In the application of the proposed methodology, an automotive
   firm selects the best alternative among three ERP outsourcing firms.

AB Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software selection is one of the most
   important decision making issues covering both qualitative and
   quantitative factors for organizations. Multiple criteria decision
   making (MCDM) has been found to be a useful approach to analyze these
   conflicting factors. Qualitative criteria are often accompanied by
   ambiguities and vagueness. This makes fuzzy logic a more natural
   approach to this kind of problems. This study presents a beneficial
   structure to the managers for use in ERP software vendor selection
   process. In order to evaluate ERP vendors methodologically, a
   hierarchical framework is also proposed. As a MCDM tool, we used
   analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and its fuzzy extension to obtain more
   decisive judgments by prioritizing criteria and assigning weights to the
   alternatives. The objective of this paper is to select the most
   appropriate alternative that meets the customer's requirements with
   respect to cost and quality constraints. In the end of this study, a
   real-world case study from Turkey is also presented to illustrate
   efficiency of the methodology and its applicability in practice.

AB An enterprise resource planning system (ERP) is the information backbone
   of a company that integrates and automates all business operations. It
   is a critical issue to select the suitable ERP system which meets all
   the business strategies and the goals of the company. This study
   presents all approach to select a Suitable ERP system for textile
   industry. Textile companies have solve difficulties to implement ERP
   systems such as variant structure of products, production variety and
   unqualified human resources. At first, the vision and the strategies of
   the organization arc checked by using balanced scorecard. According to
   the company's vision. strategies and KPIs, we call prepare a request for
   proposal. Then ERP packages that do not meet the requirements of the
   company are eliminated. After strategic management phase, the proposed
   methodology gives advice before ERP selection. The criteria were
   determined and then compared according to their importance. The rest ERP
   system solutions were selected to evaluate. An external evaluation team
   consisting of ERP consultants was assigned to select one of these
   Solutions according to the predetermined criteria. In this study, the
   fuzzy analytic hierarchy process, a fuzzy extension of the
   multi-criteria decision-making technique AHP, was used to compare these
   ERP system solutions. The methodology was applied for a textile
   manufacturing company. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Previous methods for enterprise software selection generally take into
   account the attributes that are restricted to some financial factors,
   such as costs and benefits. However, the literature lacks studies on
   considering the evaluation of both functional and non-functional
   suitability of software alternatives versus various requirements. This
   study presents a new decision support system for combining these two
   kinds of evaluation to select suitable enterprise software. A
   hierarchical objective structure that contains both qualitative and
   quantitative objectives is proposed to evaluate software products
   systematically. This approach uses a heuristic algorithm, a fuzzy
   multi-criteria decision making procedure and a multi-objective
   programming model to make final selection decision. All the phases of
   presented method are applied in an electronic company's ERP software
   selection project to validate it with a real application. The
   satisfactory results are obtained during this project. The company can
   select the right software to fit its business processes instead of
   adapting its business processes to fit the software. (C) 2008 Elsevier

AB Software development is an inherently uncertain activity. To deal with
   the uncertainty and vagueness from humans' subjective perception and
   experience in decision process, this paper presents an evaluation model
   based on the fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method for
   measuring the performance of software development projects. In an MCDM
   problem, a decision maker (DM) has to choose the best alternative that
   satisfies the evaluation criteria among a set of candidate solutions. It
   is generally hard to find an alternative that meets all the criteria
   simultaneously, so a good compromise solution is preferred. This problem
   may become more complex when multiple DMs are involved, each having not
   a common perception on the alternatives. Recently, a compromise ranking
   method (known as the VIKOR method) has been proposed to identify such
   compromise solutions, by providing a maximum group utility for the
   majority and a minimum of an individual regret for the opponent. In its
   actual setting, the method treats exact values for the assessment of the
   alternatives, which can be quite restrictive with unquantifiable
   criteria. This will be true especially if the evaluation is made by
   means of linguistic terms. For this reason we extend the VIKOR method so
   as to process such data and to provide a more comprehensive evaluation
   in a fuzzy environment. To demonstrate the potential of the methodology,
   the proposed extension is used for measuring the performance of
   enterprise resource planning (ERP) software products. (C) 2007 IMACS.

AB During the implementations of enterprise resource planning (ERP)
   systems, most companies have experienced some problems, one of which is
   how to determine the best ERP software satisfying their needs and
   expectations. Because improperly selected ERP software may have an
   impact on the time required, and the costs and market share of a
   company, selecting the best desirable ERP software has been the most
   critical problem for a long time. On the other hand, selecting ERP
   software is a multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem, and in
   the literature, many methods have been introduced to evaluate this kind
   of problem, one of which is the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), which
   has been widely used in MCDM selection problems. However, in this paper,
   we use a fuzzy extension of an analytic network process (ANP), a more
   general form of AHP, which uses uncertain human preferences as input
   information in the decision-making process, because the AHP cannot
   accommodate the variety of interactions, dependencies, and feedback
   between higher- and lower-level elements. Instead of using the classical
   eigenvector prioritization method in the AHP, only employed in the
   prioritization stage of ANP, a fuzzy-logic method providing more
   accuracy on judgements is applied. The resulting fuzzy ANP enhances the
   potential of the conventional ANP for dealing with imprecise and
   uncertain human comparison judgements. In short, in this paper, an
   intelligent approach to ERP software selection through a fuzzy ANP is
   proposed by taking into consideration quantitative and qualitative
   elements to evaluate ERP software alternatives.

AB The combination of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and
   Multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methods can bring several
   benefits for the solution of real-world planning and management
   problems. Under that view, this work aims to evaluate alternatives for
   the location of Thermoelectric Power Plants (TPP) produced in a GIS
   environment using a MCDA technique for supporting the decision-making
   process. The proposed model is a contribution for the TPP site selection
   process, which is a difficult and complex task due to the several
   economic and environmental criteria it involves. The visualization of
   the analysis outcome in GIS maps helps to demonstrate the suitability of
   MCDA techniques for planning the expansion of the electric supply
   system. In addition, the selection of a specific technology for the
   installation of the TPP in the real case application is used to show
   scenarios with different risk levels, which range from minimum to
   maximum risk conditions, also including the intermediate case of total
   trade-off. 
Y4 A integração de sistemas de informação geográfica (SIGs) e de métodos de
   decisão multicritério vêm proporcionando inúmeros benefícios para a
   resolução de problemas de planejamento e gerenciamento do mundo real.
   Sob esta ótica, este trabalho se propõe a avaliar as alternativas
   geradas em ambiente SIG para a localização de usinas termoelétricas
   (UTEs), aplicando técnicas de análise multicritério no processo de
   decisão. O modelo desenvolvido contribui para a difícil e complexa
   tarefa de analisar locais com potencial para a instalação de uma UTE e
   os diversos critérios envolvidos no problema, sejam eles de ordem
   econômica e/ou ambiental. A visualização dos resultados, através de
   mapas no SIG, mostra a aplicabilidade das técnicas de análise
   multicritério para o planejamento da expansão do setor elétrico. Além
   disso, os resultados, aplicados em um estudo de caso real, mostram
   cenários com situações de risco mínimo, médio (trade-off total) e máximo
   para uma tecnologia selecionada para a instalação da UTE.

AB This study develops a Web-based collaborative system framework based on
   a multiple perspective approach. This framework is a recent decision
   support system (DSS) paradigm proposed by Courtney [Decis. Support Syst.
   31 (2001) 17] for knowledge management of and decision making about a
   special organizational problem. It consists of four main components. The
   first component is a group decision-making (GDM) approach in which many
   participants' points of views are considered in the modeling of a
   specific problem. In the second component, many multiple criteria
   decision-making (MCDM) techniques are employed. The third component is
   an intelligent system. The fourth component is related to advanced
   communications that are supported by new technologies such as mobile
   tools, mobile e-service, and the wireless application protocol (WAP). A
   new software system called InteliTeam is developed based on the
   framework. InteliTeam can be accessed from application service providers
   (ASP), so installation of the software is not required. The software
   provides online mapping, online queries, and online analysis functions
   for users anywhere at any time. An example of the software as tested on
   many organizational problems is presented to illustrate its
   effectiveness. &COPY; 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
