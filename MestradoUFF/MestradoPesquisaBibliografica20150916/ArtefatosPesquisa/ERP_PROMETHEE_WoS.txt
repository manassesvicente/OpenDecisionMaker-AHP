AB Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, which integrates all of the
   units within an organization at the information level, plays an
   important role for a successful enterprise. With the right ERP system,
   it is easier to provide coordination.between the units, eliminate waste
   and make faster and better decisions. Adopting an ERP system is a
   significant investment decision for a firm, therefore a great deal of
   attention should be given to the selection of the right system. Since
   there are a large number of criteria to consider in selecting an ERP
   system, the process itself is regarded as a complex multi-criteria
   decision making problem. In this study, two prevalent multi-criteria
   decision making techniques, Analytic Network Process (ANP) and
   Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations
   (PROMETHEE), are used in combination to better address the ERP selection
   problem. First, ANP is used to determine the weights of all criteria,
   and then, the obtained weights are used in the PROMETHEE method for
   optimal ranking of the alternative system choices. To demonstrate the
   viability of the proposed methodology, an application case is performed
   on the ERP selection problem for the Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in
   Istanbul, Turkey. The proposed hybrid methodology successfully ranked
   the alternatives and identified the best ERP system based on the
   information obtained from a number of SMEs participated in this study.

AB Given significant investments in enterprise resource planning (ERP)
   systems, previous studies report unusually high failure rate and major
   challenges in ERP projects. The activities prior to ERP implementation,
   referred to as the pre-implementation phase, are very important because
   they significantly affect the implementation success. In this paper, the
   pre-implementation phase is focused in which necessary preparations
   before embarking on the ERP initiative, required functions and features,
   and the most appropriate ERP solution are decided. Such decisions are
   risky, costly, and very time-consuming because they necessitate working
   with a vast amount of information and require appropriate analytical
   capabilities as well as decision making methods and structures. In this
   paper, a comprehensive decision support system (DSS) is developed
   helping organisations to make the targeted decisions both efficiently
   and effectively. The proposed framework is applied in a real case study
   to illustrate its effectiveness and practicality.
